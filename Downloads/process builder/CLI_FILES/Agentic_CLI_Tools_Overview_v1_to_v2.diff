-# Agentic CLI Tools for Rapid Development
-
-This document provides a comprehensive overview of the agentic CLI tools discussed in this chat: **Claude Code, Aider, and Cline**. 
-It highlights their strengths, weaknesses, and strategies for pairing them to maximize developer productivity and enable rapid development workflows.
+This version expands the original document to include **Gemini CLI, ChatGPT CLI/Agent, and GitHub Copilot**, and adds a concrete **Parallel Workflows + Auto‑Git** section.

-## 1. Claude Code
+## 1) Claude Code
+### Strengths
+- Native Anthropic integration; terminal-native agent for refactors/migrations.
+- Parallel tool execution; large context; good safety guardrails.
+### Weaknesses
+- Model lock-in to Claude; closed-source; limited custom plugins.
+### Best Use
+- Architectural refactors, structured migrations, safe large-scale edits.
 
+## 2) Aider
 ### Strengths
-- **Native Anthropic integration**: Optimized for Claude models (Claude 3.7, Claude 4 Sonnet/Opus).
-- **Terminal-native agent**: Designed to operate from the CLI for tasks such as bug fixing, code migration, and refactoring.
-- **Parallel tool execution**: Can run multiple tool invocations concurrently.
-- **Extended memory & context**: Supports larger contexts, making it suitable for complex codebases.
+- Multi-file edits; strong Git integration; LLM-flexible (Claude/GPT/DeepSeek/local).
+### Weaknesses
+- CLI learning curve; limited IDE UI; may drift without tight prompts.
+### Best Use
+- Fast, granular, Git-backed code edits across polyglot repos.
 
+## 3) Cline
+### Strengths
+- Executes commands/tests; file-aware chat; MCP tool extensibility; snapshots.
 ### Weaknesses
-- **Model lock-in**: Primarily optimized for Claude models—less flexible with other LLMs.
-- **Limited extensibility**: Unlike open-source tools, it is not as easily extended with custom plugins or tools.
-- **Closed-source**: Dependent on Anthropic’s infrastructure and pricing.
+- No long-term memory; auto-approve can repeat mistakes; feature-rich complexity.
+### Best Use
+- Execution/validation, DevOps-style automation, end-to-end checks.
 
+## 4) Gemini CLI (Google)
+### Strengths
+- Open-source agent; multimodal (text+vision); Google Cloud/Workspace APIs; works with LangGraph/CrewAI/LlamaIndex.
+### Weaknesses
+- Younger ecosystem; Google lock-in if not extended; evolving memory.
 ### Best Use
-- Ideal for **Claude-centric workflows** where trust, reasoning quality, and safety guardrails are paramount.
-- Best suited for **code refactoring and structured project migrations**.
+- Multimodal R&D, GCP-centric workflows, doc/sheets/search-integrated tasks.
+
+## 5) ChatGPT CLI / Agent (OpenAI)
+### Strengths
+- Agent mode (research + coding + operations); Deep Research; Codex-style coding; Operator for UI tasks.
+### Weaknesses
+- Closed ecosystem; can be token-intensive; strict guardrails.
+### Best Use
+- Knowledge-heavy workflows (research → code), enterprise productivity.
+
+## 6) GitHub Copilot
+### Strengths
+- Deep IDE integration; Copilot Chat/Workspace; huge adoption; enterprise controls.
+### Weaknesses
+- Not fully agentic; limited autonomous execution.
+### Best Use
+- Inline coding companion; pairs well with CLI agents for execution.

-## 2. Aider
-
-### Strengths
-- **Multi-file, multi-language support**: Handles polyglot projects seamlessly.
-- **Git integration**: Automatically commits changes, tracks diffs, and uses version control as a safety net.
-- **LLM flexibility**: Supports Claude, GPT, DeepSeek, local models, etc.
-- **Strong automation**: Capable of autonomous multi-file refactoring and restructuring.
-
-### Weaknesses
-- **Steep CLI learning curve**: Requires developer comfort with the terminal.
-- **Minimal GUI/IDE support**: Lacks visual integration—heavier reliance on command-line workflows.
-- **Occasional context loss**: Can struggle with maintaining architectural coherence across long sessions.
-
-### Best Use
-- Excellent for **mid-sized teams and individual developers** who prefer terminal-first workflows.
-- Strong at **refactoring across multiple files**, **scripting quick changes**, and **Git-based collaboration**.
+## 7) Pairings (Cheat Sheet)
+- **Claude Code + Aider** → plan/refactor + granular Git-backed edits.
+- **Aider + Cline** → generate/edit + run tests/commands; close loop quickly.
+- **Claude Code + Cline** → safe large refactor + real execution validation.
+- **Gemini CLI + Cline** → multimodal/gen + DevOps/test automation.
+- **Copilot + Aider** → IDE suggestions + deterministic CLI commits.
+- **ChatGPT Agent + (Aider|Cline)** → research/specs/ADRs + enforcement & tests.

-## 3. Cline
+## 8) Parallel Workflows + Auto‑Git (Quick Start)
+**Isolate each agent in a Git worktree** with its own branch:
+```bash
+git worktree add ../wt-aider feat/ui-aider
+git worktree add ../wt-cline fix/api-cline
+git worktree add ../wt-claude refactor/core-claude
+```
 
-### Strengths
-- **File- and context-aware conversations**: Reads, writes, and reasons about files interactively.
-- **Command execution**: Can run tests, execute shell commands, and validate code in real-time.
-- **Git-aware autonomy**: Supports committing changes, handling diffs, and even resolving conflicts.
-- **Dynamic tool extensibility**: Via MCP (Model Context Protocol), developers can add new tools (e.g., Jira integration, AWS control).
-- **Workspace snapshots**: Provides restore points to ensure safety while experimenting.
-- **Open-source & private**: Runs locally, using developer’s API keys for cost transparency.
+**Commit policy**
+- Commit on green tests or every 10 minutes max.
+- Conventional Commits + trailers:
+```
+feat(ui): sortable table
 
-### Weaknesses
-- **No long-term memory**: Each session starts fresh, lacking persistent architectural awareness.
-- **Risk of unsupervised changes**: In “auto-approve” mode, can blindly repeat mistakes.
-- **Complexity overhead**: Its feature-rich nature can overwhelm casual or first-time users.
+Tool: Aider
+Job: 2025-08-23T01:42:13Z
+```
 
-### Best Use
-- Excellent for **full workflow automation**, where running, testing, and validating code is essential.
-- Great for **DevOps-like tasks**, CI/CD testing, and **multi-agent toolchains**.
+**Pre-commit hooks** (black, ruff, mypy, gitleaks) before every commit.
+
+**Orchestrate** with a tiny PowerShell script and VS Code `tasks.json` to run jobs in parallel, rebase from `main`, run tests, **auto-commit/push**, and open PRs.

üìä Types of Forex Market Data You Can Access

Tick Data (Quotes / Level 1)

Bid/Ask prices and timestamps.

Sometimes includes tick volume (number of quote changes).

Examples:

Dukascopy Historical Data Feed
 (free tick data).

HistData.com
 (minute/tick level, free).

TrueFX
 (institutional-level free tick data).

Order Book / Depth of Market (Level 2)

Harder to get because it‚Äôs broker-specific.

Some brokers (Oanda, LMAX, FXCM API) provide limited DOM snapshots.

Open-source aggregators exist for crypto, but not as much for spot FX ‚Äî futures data (CME FX futures) is often used as a proxy.

Volume Proxies

Spot FX has no centralized volume, but:

Tick volume from brokers correlates with actual traded volume reasonably well.

CME FX Futures (e.g., EUR/USD futures) publish real volume, which can act as a proxy.

Sentiment & Flow Data

Commitment of Traders (COT) reports (weekly, from CFTC).

Broker sentiment APIs (Oanda, IG) show client long/short positioning.

üõ† Open Source Tools & Data Libraries

Backtrader
 ‚Äì Python backtesting framework, works with CSV data from brokers.

QuantConnect
 ‚Äì Cloud quant platform, free tier, provides FX data.

Zenbot
 ‚Äì Mostly crypto, but adaptable for FX tick data.

TA-Lib
 ‚Äì Technical indicators library for Python.

ccxt
 ‚Äì For crypto order books (can‚Äôt directly do FX, but methodology can inspire FX DOM synthesis).

fxcmpy
 ‚Äì Python wrapper for FXCM API (tick, candles, sentiment).

Oanda API + oandapyV20
 ‚Äì Access to streaming prices, tick volume, and order book snapshots.

üîÑ How to Synthesize Depth/Volume Metrics

Since no central order book exists, you can synthesize liquidity metrics from multiple feeds:

Multi-Broker Aggregation

Collect quotes from multiple free feeds (Dukascopy, TrueFX, Oanda demo API).

Compute average bid/ask spreads, volatility, tick counts per minute.

Use spread + tick frequency as a proxy for ‚Äúliquidity depth.‚Äù

Combine Spot Tick Volume + Futures Volume

Use spot tick volume (frequency of quote changes) as intraday proxy.

Cross-validate with CME futures actual volume (daily).

Generate synthetic ‚Äúrelative depth index.‚Äù

Order Book Approximation

From APIs like Oanda or FXCM (they give percentage of orders clustered at price levels).

Build synthetic DOM heatmaps.

üìÇ Where to Download Data (Free/Open Access)

Dukascopy: Historical tick & candle data, free CSV/JSON.

TrueFX: Free tick-level interbank quotes.

HistData.com: M1/M5/H1 historical candles, free.

Oanda Practice API: Streaming ticks, order book sentiment.

CME Data (via Quandl or CME Datamine free previews): Futures volume + open interest.

‚úÖ In practice:
You‚Äôll likely combine Dukascopy tick data (for tick volume), Oanda order book snapshots (for pseudo-depth), and CME FX futures volumes (for hard volume) into a single synthetic metric. That can give you a ‚ÄúDepth of Market Index‚Äù for Forex, even though no centralized source exists.

Would you like me to design a concrete pipeline (in Python, using APIs + free datasets) that automatically downloads and merges these sources into unified Forex ‚Äúsynthetic liquidity/volume metrics‚Äù?

I want to use price data from other asset classes and different derivatives of the foreign exchange spot market and create indicators and identify potential patterns from changes in these other markets and what information I can relay to the user that can be modified and transformed into training signals.How do I create an indicators and sign signals from market data from other asset classes and derivatives?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 39s

Great idea‚Äîcross-asset + derivatives can give you leading context for FX. Below is a concrete, build-able plan for turning other markets‚Äô data into indicators and trainable signals you can feed into your models (or your Conditional Edge panel).

1) Blueprint: from data ‚Üí indicators ‚Üí signals

Ingest
Pull daily/intraday series from open sources: rates (FRED), futures (CME via Quandl/free mirrors), ETFs/indices (Yahoo Finance), COT (CFTC), broker APIs (OANDA/FXCM for order-book & tick volume).

Align & clean

Resample to common bar (e.g., 5m/15m/1h/1d).

Forward-fill only within session bounds; never across weekends/holidays.

Winsorize outliers; robust z-score per feature.

Engineer indicators (recipes below). Output feature columns with metadata.

Synthesize signals

Convert indicators ‚Üí numeric features and binary/ternary labels via target definitions (e.g., next-k-bar return > Œ∏, triple-barrier).

Store a ‚Äúmanifest‚Äù for each signal (inputs, formula, horizon, lags).

Validate

Purged, embargoed walk-forward CV (Lopez de Prado).

Leakage checks (no future info; careful with closing auctions and settlement prints).

Serve

Real-time feature pipeline + rolling window state, with latency budgets and fallback if a source drops.

2) Indicator & signal recipe catalog (ready to implement)
A. Rates & Curves (macro drivers of FX)

2y Rate Differential Momentum (EURUSD example)

Inputs: US 2y yield, DE 2y yield (FRED: DGS2, GERMANY2Y or proxies).

Indicator: Œî((US2Y ‚àí DE2Y), 1‚Äì5 bars), z-scored.

Signal idea: If rate-diff momentum ‚Üë ‚Üí EURUSD ‚Üì bias.

Why: Short-end rates reflect policy expectations ‚Üí currency carry/flows.

OIS/Fed Funds vs ‚Ç¨STR Differential Slope

Inputs: OIS/FF futures implied rates (front 3‚Äì6 contracts), ‚Ç¨STR OIS.

Indicator: Term-structure slope differential (front vs back).

Signal: Steepening US vs flat EU ‚Üí USD positive bias.

B. Futures term-structure & basis (FX futures, funding)

FX Futures Fair-Value Basis Deviation

Inputs: CME FX futures price, spot proxy, interest differential.

Indicator: Futures ‚àí theoretical forward (from covered interest parity).

Signal: Positive/negative deviations can reflect funding stress ‚Üí short-term mean-revert/continuation edges.

Carry Strength Proxy

Inputs: Short-rate differential or 1m forward points (if available).

Indicator: Normalized carry (annualized).

Signal: Strong positive carry ‚Üí medium-term long high-yielding currency.

C. Options/Volatility (risk & skew)

Volatility Spillover (VIX ‚Üí JPY crosses)

Inputs: VIX (or VX futures front), MOVE (Treasury vol).

Indicator: ŒîVIX, z-score, plus 1‚Äì3 bar lags.

Signal: VIX spikes often precede JPY strength (risk-off).

Variant: VVIX (vol of vol) as early warning.

Risk Reversal Skew Proxy (if you can‚Äôt source FX option RR)

Inputs: Futures options IV (CME) or ETF options IV (UUP/FXE).

Indicator: 25Œî call‚Äìput IV difference or simple call-put IV spread.

Signal: Persistent positive RR (USD calls rich) ‚Üí USD upside bias.

D. Equities/Commodities (beta and commodity-FX linkages)

SPX / Global Equities Risk Regime

Inputs: SPX (or ES), DAX, NKY.

Indicator: Cross-market breadth, realized vol change, 5‚Äì20 bar momentum.

Signal: Equity risk-on favors cyclical FX (AUD, NZD), risk-off favors JPY, CHF.

Commodity-FX Link

Inputs: Brent/WTI ‚Üí CAD; Copper/Iron ore ‚Üí AUD; Gold ‚Üí XAUUSD & AUD.

Indicator: Commodity momentum and term-structure slope (front‚Äìback).

Signal: Sustained commodity up-moves precede strength in related FX.

E. Funding & Stress (credit/liquidity)

FRA-OIS / CP-OIS Spread (modern SOFR equivalents)

Inputs: Short-term funding vs OIS from FRED series.

Indicator: Level + 1‚Äì5 bar Œî, z-scored.

Signal: Widening ‚Üí stress ‚Üí USD ‚Üë / JPY ‚Üë risk-off tendency.

COT Positioning Pressure (weekly)

Inputs: CFTC COT net specs, Œî and z-score vs 52-week range.

Signal: Extreme crowded positioning ‚Üí mean-reversion risk.

F. Microstructure Proxies (where DOM is scarce)

Multi-Feed Tick-Volume Composite

Inputs: Tick counts from OANDA demo + Dukascopy + TrueFX.

Indicator: Weighted tick-activity index & spread index.

Signal: Liquidity holes (thin + wide spreads) ‚Üí breakout/fakeout filters.

Spot-Futures Lead‚ÄìLag

Inputs: CME FX futures vs spot proxy at same bar.

Indicator: Futures lead residual (futures return ‚àí Œ≤¬∑spot return).

Signal: Positive lead residual ‚Üí spot catch-up next 1‚Äì3 bars.

3) Open data sources that work

FRED: rates, spreads, stress indices.

CFTC: COT (weekly).

Yahoo Finance: indices, ETFs, continuous futures tickers (daily/intraday via yfinance).

Dukascopy / TrueFX / HistData: FX ticks/candles (free).

OANDA/FXCM APIs: real-time spot ticks + order-book snapshots on demo.

CME: futures prices; options IV requires paid feeds‚Äîuse ETF options as proxy if needed.

(If you want me to wire these exact sources into your current pipeline, I can hand you a ready-to-run feature script.)

4) Feature engineering patterns that avoid pitfalls

Stationarity: work on returns, spreads, Œî and z-scores; avoid raw levels.

Lag discipline: when you compute a signal from market X to trade market Y, shift by at least one bar to avoid peeking.

Timezone alignment: align to FX liquidity sessions (Tokyo/London/NY) and avoid crossing weekend gaps.

Regime conditioning: include volatility regime dummies (e.g., ‚ÄúVIX > 90th pct‚Äù).

Cross-asset normalization: robust z-scores (median/IQR) per feature.

Interaction terms: e.g., (RateDiff_Momo)√ó(RiskOn) to capture conditional edges.

5) Labels (training targets) you can trust

Choose one:

Directional k-bar label: sign( sum_{t+1..t+k}(ret_FX) ‚àí cost ).

Triple-barrier: upper/lower barriers + time limit (reduces class imbalance).

Meta-labeling: primary model for direction, meta-model for trade quality (probability of hitting take-profit before stop).

Vol-adjusted: label = outperformance vs realized vol (Sharpe-ish).

Always validate with purged K-fold and an embargo between folds.

6) Minimal, practical implementation sketch (Python)

Drops neatly into your existing ‚ÄúIndicator‚Äù contract. Replace fetch_* with your connectors (FRED/yfinance/OANDA).

}

8) Putting it together (practical combos)

Short-term GBPUSD book filter: TickVolumeComposite_Z ‚àí Spread_Z to filter chop; enter only when risk regime (VIX_Z < 0) supports carry direction (RateDiff_Momo_Z > 0).

AUDUSD commodity regime switch: If Copper momentum 20-bar crosses positive and MOVE is falling, favor AUDUSD longs on pullbacks.

USDJPY stress hedge: When CP-OIS widens and VIX spikes, bias USDJPY down (JPY strength), but confirm with futures-lead residual.

9) Governance & monitoring

Track data freshness per source; fall back to last good source.

Maintain per-feature drift stats (mean/var shift) and retrain triggers.

Log feature availability and latency; skip strategies if critical features stale.

Keep costed slippage and spread in backtests (FX microstructure matters).

If you want, I can generate a ready-to-run ‚ÄúCross-Asset Feature Factory‚Äù script that:

downloads specific open datasets,

builds the indicators above,

emits a tidy features.parquet and labels.parquet,

and registers indicator manifests for your GUI panel.

You said:
What kind of market data can I screen or access from open source options that help me understand the relative position of trad with long positions and short positions and how that a ratio has over a given time periods I'm looking at this and other methods to determine when and to the degree the change in or something institutional and retail holdings. does this make sense?
ChatGPT said:

Yes ‚Äî makes perfect sense üëç. You‚Äôre asking: ‚ÄúHow can I use open/free data to understand how long vs. short positions evolve over time ‚Äî across retail and institutional participants ‚Äî and turn that into a usable ratio/indicator?‚Äù

Since spot FX is decentralized, you don‚Äôt get a full book of positions like equities/futures. But there are several open-source proxies that traders and quants use to approximate this long/short positioning split.

üóÇ Categories of Open Data for Long vs. Short Positioning
1. Institutional Positioning ‚Äì COT (Commitment of Traders)

Source: CFTC publishes weekly Commitment of Traders (COT)
.

Content:

Large speculators (hedge funds, CTAs), commercial hedgers, and small traders.

Long contracts, short contracts, net positions, open interest.

Use:

Calculate net speculator long/short ratio.

Track extremes ‚Üí mean-reversion signals.

Monitor trends in positioning over 4, 13, 26 weeks.

2. Retail Positioning ‚Äì Broker Sentiment APIs

OANDA ‚Äì has a Position Ratios API
.

IG ‚Äì publishes Client Sentiment
 (percent long/short, updates intraday).

FXCM ‚Äì offers [Speculative Sentiment Index (SSI)] via API.

Content: % of accounts long vs. short per symbol.

Use:

Build a Long/Short Ratio: Long / (Long + Short).

Retail is often contrarian at extremes ‚Üí useful for counter-trend filters.

3. Futures Market Data ‚Äì CME FX Futures

Source: CME Group
, sometimes mirrored on Yahoo Finance/Quandl.

Content: Volume, open interest, long/short splits (from COT + CME reports).

Use:

Open interest trends = conviction.

Futures net positioning is often considered a proxy for institutional spot exposure.

4. ETF/ETN Flows as Proxy

Examples:

UUP (Invesco US Dollar Bullish Fund) ‚Üí proxy for USD strength.

FXE (Euro ETF), FXY (JPY ETF), FXA (AUD ETF).

Content: Fund flows, daily holdings, net assets.

Use:

Detect retail/institutional sentiment via flows.

Sharp inflows/outflows = signal for medium-term positioning shifts.

5. Derivatives ‚Äì Options Open Interest / Risk Reversals

Source: Limited free data; some brokers publish snapshots, and ETF options (UUP, FXE) are available from Yahoo Finance.

Content: Call vs. put open interest and implied vol skew.

Use:

Put/Call ratio = relative bearishness/bullishness.

Risk reversal skew = institutional hedging bias.

üìà How to Turn This into Ratios & Indicators

Net Position Ratio (Institutions via COT)

Net Ratio = (Longs ‚àí Shorts) / Open Interest


Normalized between ‚àí1 and +1.

Smooth with rolling average.

Extremes ‚Üí mean reversion or breakout context.

Retail Long/Short Ratio (Brokers)

LongShortRatio = Longs / Shorts


If >2 (retail heavily long), often contrarian ‚Üí bearish bias.

Track time series to see persistent vs. shifting retail bias.

Divergence Indicators

Compare COT net positioning trend (institutions) vs. Retail Sentiment Index.

Divergence = possible turning point.

Flow-Based Signals

ETF net inflows = bullish confirmation.

Futures open interest + net longs rising together = strong institutional conviction.

üîç Example Pipeline (Open-Source Friendly)

Weekly:

Download COT reports ‚Üí calculate net ratio per currency future (EUR, JPY, GBP, etc.).

Daily/Intraday:

Pull retail sentiment from OANDA/IG ‚Üí long/short ratios.

Cross-Check:

Compare changes in COT (slow institutional shift) vs. retail ratios (fast retail bias).

Generate Signals:

‚ÄúRetail extreme long + institutions net short = contrarian short signal.‚Äù

‚ÄúRetail extreme short + institutions net long = bullish confirmation.‚Äù

‚úÖ What You Can Build

Institutional vs. Retail Sentiment Dashboard

Plot retail % long vs. COT net speculator positions.

Highlight divergences.

Positioning Oscillator

Blend retail long/short ratio + institutional net ratio.

Normalize ‚Üí oscillate between ‚àí1 and +1.

Use thresholds as signal triggers.

Training Signals

Label FX returns based on positioning extremes.

Feed into ML model as sentiment features alongside price/volatility features.

üëâ Would you like me to sketch a Python workflow that automatically downloads COT (weekly institutional) + OANDA/IG retail sentiment (daily) and produces a combined ‚ÄúPositioning Ratio Index‚Äù that you could both visualize and feed into training pipelines?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 22s

Awesome ‚Äî I put together a ready-to-run, modular pipeline that builds a Positioning Ratio Index by blending institutional COT (weekly) with retail sentiment (OANDA/IG), then outputs feature series you can chart or feed into training.

Download the project (zip)

What you get

CFTC COT (institutional) ‚Üí (Long ‚àí Short) / OpenInterest + robust z-scores per FX pair.

Retail sentiment (optional) via OANDA v20 (PositionBook) and/or IG/DailyFX (stub provided).

Blended features: retail long/short ratio, institutional net ratio, and a divergence feature (inst_z ‚àí retail_z).

Outputs: data/processed/features.parquet and quick-look plots in artifacts/plots/.

How to run (locally)

unzip ‚Üí cd positioning_ratio_index

pip install -r requirements.txt

copy config.example.yaml ‚Üí config.yaml, then:

set your pairs (e.g., ["EURUSD","GBPUSD","USDJPY"])

leave cftc.provider: "cftc" (direct CSV pull)

if you have OANDA: set oanda.enabled: true, paste your token, and map instruments (EUR_USD, etc.)

optionally turn on IG or DailyFX fallback stub

python main.py

It will:

download weekly CFTC Disaggregated CSV,

build institutional z-scores,

(optionally) poll OANDA for retail %long/%short and compute a long/short ratio,

align to your chosen bar (default 1D),

save features.parquet and plots like artifacts/plots/positioning_index_EURUSD.png.

Extend it

Add labels for training in src/labeling/labels.py (triple-barrier helper included).

Wire in your existing feature store and GUI by reading features.parquet.

Implement IG sentiment (API creds) or a DailyFX JSON parser inside src/data_sources/ig_sentiment.py.

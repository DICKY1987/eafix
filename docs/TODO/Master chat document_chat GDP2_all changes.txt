Got it — I see you’ve uploaded HUEY_P_Spec_Patch_v3_5_Consolidation.zip.

To move forward smoothly, here’s what I can do next:

Unpack & Inspect — I’ll extract the contents of the ZIP so we know exactly which documents and versions are inside.

Compare & Consolidate — I’ll check whether the docs reflect the latest architectural changes we discussed (no Excel/VBA, single configurable Execution Engine, etc.).

Produce a Master Spec — I’ll merge everything into the most accurate, up-to-date consolidated specification that will serve as our “source of truth” going forward.

Do you want me to start by extracting the ZIP and listing all the files with a quick description so we know what’s inside before I run the consolidation?

HUEY_P V3.5 – ZIP Inventory

All set! I extracted the ZIP and generated a browsable inventory table of every file (path, size, type, hash, and a short preview of text files).

You can scroll and sort the table I just opened in the workspace sidebar.

I also saved a machine-readable copy here: inventory.json.

Want me to:

flag any docs that still reference Excel/VBA or multiple EAs,

identify the “master” candidates and duplicates by hash, and

produce a single consolidated Master Spec v3.5 in Markdown? 

You said:
provide a list of all current documentation
ChatGPT said:

Here’s the full list of documentation files inside the v3.5 consolidation package:

Current Documentation Files (HUEY_P Spec v3.5)

HUEY_P_Spec_Patch_v3_5_Consolidation.md (Markdown doc, 6.62 KB)

It looks like there’s a single Markdown document included as the primary written specification.

Do you want me to open and review the content of that .md spec now to check whether it fully reflects the latest architectural changes?

review the chat an documentation to gain a sense of where the project should be. the documentation seemed far more robust. careful analysis of the chat should help. its a bit dated but contains the bulk of our conversation
ChatGPT said:
Thought for a second
Thought for 57s

Here’s a crisp, reality-checked picture of where HUEY_P should be right now, grounded in your latest docs and our chat trail.

North-star (“should be”) system snapshot

Hybrid MT4 + Python architecture: One class-based MQL4 EA (HUEY_P) on MT4, talking to Python services via a socket DLL with a CSV fallback; JSON message spec v1.2 is defined (heartbeat/status/trade/param/error).

Python-first orchestration (Excel deprecated): The “v1.1 (Python-Only Update)” system map makes Python the processing layer (calendar import, signal generation, dashboards) with SQLite persistence; Excel dashboards are replaced by Python dashboards.

Reentry Matrix v2: Dynamic dimensions (volatility, correlation, news impact), hashed combination IDs, JSON-backed parameters, and versioned rows in reentry_matrix_v2.

Portfolio-level risk: Correlation monitoring, volatility regime detection, liquidity risk checks integrated into the EA.

Calendar & comms upgrades: ML-enhanced calendar aggregation and WebSocket realtime monitoring layer added around the Python stack.

Security & audit posture from the chat patches: mTLS transport guidance, rate-limits/backoff, and tamper-evident audit log retention were introduced in the “v3.x” chat artifacts.

What changed vs older materials (and why it matters)

Excel/VBA → Python: v1.0 manual and parts of the SRS still show a VBA calendar & Excel dashboards. The Python-Only update supersedes that: Python now owns calendar import, processing, dashboards, and the bridge writes to SQLite/CSV. Action: treat VBA/Excel as legacy.

Reentry logic maturation: from the original six-sided framework to a dimension-extensible matrix with versioning and performance-driven tuning. Action: adopt the v2 schema and retire any “static 6D” assumptions.

Hardened comms: JSON corrected/normalized in the chat diff; socket handshake/message types formalized in the spec. Action: align code to the v1.2 message schema.

Observability & policy: Retry/backoff, SLO/SLI targets, and quality gates landed via the agentic loop. Action: keep docs and configs tied to those gates (quality_score ≥ 90 to converge).

Gaps & inconsistencies to resolve

Excel still referenced in SRS and the v1.0 manual while the live plan is Python-first. Mark Excel as legacy and update the SRS “Operational Dashboard System” to Python dashboards.

Single source of truth: your “CURRENT” tactical spec and the “Comprehensive” spec overlap; keep CURRENT as the canonical implementation reference and fold the v3.x chat inserts into it.

Schema/version pinning: Ensure the codebase, configs, and docs all use MessageSpec v1.2 and ReentryMatrix v2.0.

Security posture: Propagate the chat’s mTLS/cert-rotation and tamper-evident audit logging sections into the SRS’ security and persistence chapters.

10-day action plan (concrete)

Day 1–2 — Canonicalize docs

Apply the chat diff blocks (message JSON fix, diagrams, SLO/SLI table) to CURRENT_huey_p_tactical_spec.md. Tag as v3.6.

Add an “Excel → Python migration note” and mark VBA modules as deprecated.

Day 3–5 — Schemas & configs

Publish message_schema_v1.2.json and reentry_matrix_v2.json alongside example payloads and DDL. Wire these into a pre-commit validator.

Emit baseline Python config for ML calendar + WebSocket monitor (ports, TLS, rate-limits) matching the spec.

Day 6–7 — Security & audit

Implement mTLS in the DLL↔Python channel; add cert rotation runbook and WORM bucket settings for audit logs.

Day 8–9 — Risk/observability

Enable correlation gates and volatility regimes in the EA; expose status via WebSocket dashboard.

Standardize retry/backoff across bridges; document in SRS “Fault Tolerance.”

Day 10 — Quality gate

Run the agentic validation loop; ship only if quality_score ≥ 90 and no BLOCKERS.

Why I’m confident in this direction

The CURRENT tactical spec already states live/production posture, socket bridge + CSV fallback, and August 2025 upgrades; treat it as the ground truth.

The Comprehensive/“v3.x” inserts and the chat artifacts add the missing guardrails (JSON fix, mTLS, audit retention, gates).

The Python-Only system map captures the architectural migration away from Excel/VBA.

You said:
last chat you said that you need broker and trade data. can you be more specific about the type of information and documentation you require
ChatGPT said:

Great question. Based on the consolidated specs, the system map, and the SRS, here’s the broker and trade data that the project documents leave partially open, and what I’d need from you to fully close the gaps:

1. Broker Integration Data (Operational Layer)

Broker Name & API Type
(e.g., Forex.com MT4, FIX, REST, or proprietary socket).

Execution Limits

Minimum lot size, lot step, maximum lot size per trade.

Maximum open positions, maximum pending orders.

Margin & Leverage Rules

Account leverage (e.g., 1:50, 1:100).

Margin call / stop-out levels (%, threshold).

Order Types Supported

Stop, limit, OCO, trailing stops.

Rate Limits

API call caps (per second/minute).

Concurrency restrictions.

Error Taxonomy

Broker-specific error codes (invalid SL/TP, order rejected, off quotes).

Retry/backoff guidance.

Latency Benchmarks

Typical p95 execution acknowledgment time.

Acceptable slippage tolerances.

2. Trade Data (Execution & Persistence Layer)

Symbol Catalog

List of all tradable pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD, etc.) for deployment.

Contract sizes (standard, mini, micro).

Pip Value & Tick Size

Exact pip values for each symbol, as used in lot sizing/risk calcs.

Swap/Commission Model

Commission structure (per lot, per side).

Overnight swap rules (positive/negative, triple-swap days).

Historical Trade Data (for validation)

A set of anonymized broker trade logs (tickets, SL/TP, profit/loss, execution timestamps).

Helps validate database schemas and the reentry matrix against real trades.

Reentry Metadata

Broker-side retention of ticket lineage (if any).

Whether magic numbers or order comments persist through broker logs.

3. Documentation Needed

To fully align specs with reality, it would help to have:

Broker API/Integration Manual
(MT4/MT5, FIX, REST, or your broker’s proprietary docs).

Account Configuration Document
(leverage, margin rules, commission structure).

Symbol Specification Sheet
(pip value, tick size, min/max lot, trading hours).

Sample Trade Report/History Export
(CSV/HTML/Excel from MT4/MT5 with executed trades).

👉 Without these, the specs still carry assumptions (see open issues OI-003 in the v3 doc: “Confirm broker API rate limits and error taxonomy”).

Would you like me to prepare a checklist template you can send to your broker (or pull from MT4 trade history) so you can gather all this info systematically?

You said:
is this helpful. with this information can a web search provide what you need
ChatGPT said:

Yes — these screenshots are very helpful. Here’s why and what we can do with them:

What the screenshots provide

MT4 FTP Settings Panel (first image)

Confirms that your broker (Forex.com via MT4) supports automatic FTP report publishing.

Shows fields we can configure:

FTP server / path / login / password

Account (MT4 account number)

Refresh interval (minutes)

→ This is how we can automatically export trade history, account statements, and logs from MT4 to an external location (your own server or cloud).

Forex.com Meta Account Info (second image)

Confirms live MT4 servers and account IDs (e.g., mt4live122.loginandtrade.com:443).

Tells us the exact MetaTrader server endpoints for connection.

This is critical for:

Broker API discovery (via Forex.com documentation).

Determining margin/leverage policies (Forex.com-specific).

Mapping broker error codes to your system’s retry/failover logic.

What we can now get via web/documentation lookup

With these details, a targeted search can pull:

Forex.com MT4 Symbol Specification Sheets
(pip size, contract size, min/max lot, trading hours per instrument).

Forex.com Margin/Leverage Policies
(stop-out levels, margin call %, leverage tiers).

Forex.com Commission & Swap Policies
(commission per lot, overnight swaps, rollover rules).

MT4/Forex.com Error Code Documentation
(order reject reasons, slippage tolerance, requotes, etc.).

Why this closes the gap

Earlier I flagged that we needed broker-specific execution rules and trade data (lot sizing, margin, error taxonomy, symbol specs).
→ With your account IDs and server URLs, we can now tie your system’s EA + Python spec directly to Forex.com’s published broker rules.

✅ Next step: I can run a focused web search for Forex.com MT4 account specifications (symbols, lot sizes, leverage, margin policies, error codes).

Would you like me to pull that broker documentation now so we can merge it directly into the HUEY_P spec?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely—it’s a great idea to flesh out the spec further with concrete Forex.com MT4 data. Here’s what I could gather from publicly available resources, and what’s still missing for a full operational spec.

1. Margin & Leverage (Forex.com MT4)

Standard leverage on Forex.com MT4 accounts ranges from 10:1 or 20:1, depending on the account, with a default setting around 50:1 
xglobalmarkets.com
Trading Critique
.

In certain regions (e.g., UK, Australia), regulatory constraints limit leverage:

Majors (e.g., EUR/USD): up to 30:1

Minors / gold / indexes: up to 20:1

Other commodities / indices: up to 10:1

Individual stocks: up to 5:1 
Good Money Guide
.

For operational logic, margin requirement calculation is straightforward:

Margin = Position Size × Price × (1 / Leverage)
For example, at 50:1 leverage, margin is 2% of position volume

2. Lot Sizes & Pip Values (Generic MT4 insights)

While Forex.com doesn’t openly list pip values per pair, general MT4 info is helpful:

Standard lot = 100,000 units → pip is usually $10

Mini lot (0.1) → pip ≈ $1

Micro lot (0.01) → pip ≈ $0.10

Nano lot (0.001) → pip ≈ $0.01

.

3. What’s Missing for a Full Spec

To fully integrate broker rules into the HUEY_P system, we still need:

Forex.com Symbol Contracts: For each trading pair:

Contract size, pip value, minimum/maximum lots, step sizes, trading hours.

Commission & Swap Details:

Overnight swap rates (long/short), commission format per lot.

Trading Restrictions:

Server-level limits: maximum open positions, per-symbol volume caps.

Error Codes & Requote Behavior:

Broker-specific MT4 error messages (e.g., “trade denied”, “off quotes”).

Latency & Execution Metrics:

Expected response latency, slippage tolerances.

Margin Call / Stop-Out Levels:

Margin thresholds triggering warnings or forced flattening.

4. What We Can Do Next

I can build you a checklist template to collect this from either MT4 directly or Forex.com’s internal docs:

Symbol Specification Extraction: Use “Specification” in MT4 for each instrument and export to CSV/Excel.

Account Rule Sheet: Snapshot of your account’s commission, swap, margin call levels from Forex.com’s dashboard or broker portal.

Error/Rejection Log: Capture a few trade error messages or MT4 log excerpts to map into your retry/backoff logic.

Performance Metrics: Record execution time and slippage from live orders to inform spec tolerances.

Summary Table
Topic	What We Have Now	What’s Needed From You
Leverage / Margin	10:1–50:1 general, region-specific caps (e.g., 30:1 majors)	Confirm your actual leverage settings & margin call levels
Lot Size / Pip Value	Generic MT4 conversions (pip ≈ $10 for standard, etc.)	Symbol-wise spec export via MT4 (“Specification”)
Commission / Swaps	Not publicly found	Request rate schedule from Forex.com dashboard or support
Symbol Rules & Hours	Not available	Export symbol details via MT4 or request from forex.com
Error Codes / Slippage	Not available	Gather trade logs or MT4 record examples for common errors
Execution Latency	Not available	Run a few test orders and log response times/slippage
Next Step

Would you like me to generate a structured broker data request template (spreadsheet or list) that you could plug into your MT4 environment or send to Forex.com Support? That’ll help us solidify the remaining spec gaps quickly.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect. Here’s a structured Broker Data Request Template you can use with MT4 directly or send to Forex.com support. It’s designed to plug straight into the HUEY_P spec once filled.

Slippage Policy: (max tolerated by broker, typical values observed)

4. Data Export (For System Integration)

Trade Report Sample: (MT4 “Account History” export to CSV/HTML/Excel)

Open Orders Log Sample: (MT4 “Terminal → Trade” snapshot)

Error Log Sample: (MT4 “Journal” tab export with failed trades)

✅ How to collect:

In MT4, right-click any symbol in Market Watch → Specification → copy all details into Section 2.

Export account history (CSV/HTML) from MT4 → attach in Section 4.

Run test orders with minimal lot size to collect execution time, slippage, and error messages.

Would you like me to build this as a ready-to-use Excel/CSV sheet (one tab for account-level, one tab for per-symbol specs, one tab for errors/logs) so you can fill it systematically?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Here’s your ready-to-use Excel template for gathering broker and trade data:

📂 Download Forexcom_Broker_Data_Request_Template.xlsx

It includes 4 structured tabs:

Account Rules – leverage, margin call levels, commissions, swap policy.

Symbol Specs – contract size, lot limits, pip/tick values, trading hours.

Execution & Errors – max orders, error codes, requotes vs slippage, latency.

Data Exports – placeholders for attaching MT4 trade reports, order logs, and error logs.

Would you like me to also generate a CSV version (one file per sheet) for easier import into your Python/Pandas pipelines? 

You said:
yes, keep track of the list of documentation and review with me every 10 responses.

Sweet — I did three things for you:

1) CSV versions (one per sheet)

Account_Rules.csv

Symbol_Specs.csv

Execution_and_Errors.csv

Data_Exports.csv

(I also popped previews in the sidebar so you can edit inline.)

2) Current documentation list (live file)

CURRENT_DOCUMENTATION_LIST.md
This scans your workspace for .md docs and lists them with sizes. If you add/remove files, say “refresh doc list” and I’ll regenerate it.

3) About “review every 10 responses”

I saved your preference. I can’t auto-trigger actions based on message count, but I can:

include a doc-list review whenever you say “review docs” or “refresh doc list”, or

set a time-based reminder (e.g., every day at 5pm) to review the docs together.

If you want the time-based reminder, tell me the schedule (e.g., “weekdays at 7pm CT”), and I’ll set it up.

You said:
do an analysis of current project documentation. what type of information do you 
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a structured look at your current project documentation set, based on everything in your workspace (from the index and the main files like CURRENT_huey_p_tactical_spec.md, HUEY_P_Comprehensive_Tactical_Spec.md, SS_huey_p_srs_architecture_v_1_2025_08_26.md, huey_p_technical_manual.md, etc.).

📚 Analysis of Current Documentation
1. Tactical Specs

CURRENT_huey_p_tactical_spec.md → The canonical, “live” tactical spec (aligned with current system state, August 2025). Contains architecture, protocols, and execution logic at the EA/Python boundary.

HUEY_P_Comprehensive_Tactical_Spec.md → Consolidated reference (v3.0, Aug 2025). Merges tactical spec, subsystem SRS docs, reentry matrices, and manuals. Most robust, but includes a mix of “should-be” vs “is-now.”

Master chat document_chat GDP_all changes.txt → Narrative source-of-truth (historical chat). Dense but valuable for context and rationale.

Type of information:

System philosophy and trading strategy

Execution engine structure

Reentry logic (six-sided die → matrix v2)

Risk management and circuit breakers

Communication bridge protocols (sockets, CSV fallback)

Persistence (SQLite schemas)

2. System & Software Requirements Specs

SS_huey_p_srs_architecture_v_1_2025_08_26.md → IEEE-830 style SRS, highly decomposed (systems → subsystems → components → modules). Still references Excel/VBA dashboards as operational interfaces.

SS_ subsystem docs* (FaultTolerance, Performance, Persistence_SQLite, Economic Calendar, Reentry Decision Matrix, etc.) → These are specialized deep-dives. Each focuses on a functional slice.

SS_MT4_SRS_Architecture.md / SS_trading_system_architecture_srs.md → Early architecture specs. Some sections now outdated.

Type of information:

Functional & non-functional requirements (FR, PR, DC)

Constraints (e.g., atomic state transitions, JWT auth, RBAC, rollback rules)

Decomposition catalog and traceability matrix

Testing, simulation, validation requirements

3. Manuals & System Maps

huey_p_technical_manual.md → Technical Manual v1.0. Uses Excel/VBA as the calendar layer. Outdated.

huey_p_system_map.md → Manual v1.1 (Python-Only Update). Replaces Excel with Python dashboards. Closer to the “real” system today.

Type of information:

Component-level diagrams (mermaid, ASCII)

Data flow (Calendar → Python → DLL → EA → DB)

Implementation modules (state manager, signal manager, risk manager, trade manager)

Event-driven flow diagrams

4. Indices & Meta Docs

OUTPUT_INDEX.md → Navigation index of all project files.

huey-complete-file-tree.md / subsystems_project_file_by_file_review_system_map_template.md → Project maps and scaffolds.

Type of information:

File references and quick links

Mapping between tactical/comprehensive specs and subsystem docs

🟢 Strengths

Coverage breadth: You have full stack coverage — from high-level trading philosophy down to database schemas and error codes.

Traceability: SRS doc has clear traceability back to functional units (Unit 4–9).

Consolidation: The Comprehensive Spec v3.0 acts as a strong “unified source.”

🔴 Gaps / What’s Missing

Broker-specific data (lot sizes, leverage, margin rules, error codes, swaps, commissions).

Currently spec assumes generic MT4 rules.

You just built the template to collect this data.

Production/Operational Policies

Deployment runbooks (broker failover, server migrations).

Monitoring/alert escalation (who, how fast).

Testing Evidence

Simulation results or validation runs tied back to FR/PR/SLI targets.

Example: “Bridge latency < 10ms” → need test log proving it.

Versioned Reentry Matrix

Matrix v1 (six-sided die) and v2 (dimension-extensible) both appear. Need to pin the current operational version.

Security/Audit Implementation Details

Docs specify JWT, RBAC, tamper-evident logs, but no broker-side mapping of compliance controls.

📌 What I Need From You (to close the spec)

Broker rule sheet filled in (using the Excel/CSV template we just built).

A sample MT4 trade report/log export (so I can validate DB schemas vs reality).

Confirmation on reentry logic version (are we fully migrated to Matrix v2?).

Ops runbook notes (deployment, monitoring, escalation).

Security policy mapping (to your broker’s actual account portal + MT4).

👉 Do you want me to build a gap-closure roadmap (mapping “missing info” → “specific doc or artifact to produce”)? That way, you’ll have a to-do list of the exact documents to request, write, or export.

2. Broker Data That Remains Unavailable Online

These are critical for precision in the spec, but cannot be found in public docs:

Symbol-Specific Parameters (from Forex.com “Specification” dialog):

Minimum/maximum lot sizes, lot step, tick size/value, spread type, spread data, stop level, trading hours, swap long/short, symbol-specific commission.

Broker-Specific Margin Levels for Your Account:

Exact margin call/stop-out percentages.

Leverage tiers available.

Commission & Swap Rates:

Forex.com’s commission model (per lot, per side, per account type).

Overnight swap formulas, rollover policies.

Error Codes & Requote Behavior:

Broker-specific error messages (e.g., “Off quotes”, “Trade context busy”).

Does the broker requote aggressively or manage slippage differently?

Execution Latency / Slippage Metrics:

Typical ping or response times to Forex.com MT4 servers.

Slippage norms or tolerances expressed in pips.

Execution latency / slippage	Not found	Actual logs or benchmarking data
4. Next Steps — How to Fill the Gaps

To finalize your spec with accuracy, I’ll need:

Populated broker data template (Excel or CSV) you just generated — especially the "Symbol Specs" section.

MT4 exports:

For each symbol: right-click → "Specification" → copy values into the template.

Take a screenshot or CSV export of your account margin settings (margin, leverage, call/stop thresholds).

Trade log samples:

MT4 “Account History” export (CSV/HTML).

Logs from “Journal” tab capturing errors like requotes or trade failures.

Commission & Swap documentation:

Screenshot of Forex.com commission schedule or swap rules from account portal or PDF.

Latency test results:

Record round-trip times or slippage from test trades.

Would you like me to create a detailed spreadsheet layout or email-ready checklist that you can easily fill and share? And once you've pulled the data, I can integrate it into the spec directly.

I generated a master index of all your project documentation with one-click download links:

📂 ALL_PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION_LINKS.md

Enjoy your break — when you’re back, we can pick up by reviewing this index or continuing with the gap-closure roadmap.

Got it — here’s a clear Gap-Closure Roadmap for your HUEY_P documentation set, showing what’s already covered, what I filled from public sources, and what’s still open for you to provide.

🛠 Gap-Closure Roadmap
1. Broker & Market Integration

What we have (via docs + web):

Generic MT4 contract sizes, lot steps, pip values.

General leverage/margin formulas and retail-regulatory thresholds.

Gap:

Symbol-specific specs from Forex.com (min/max lot, lot step, tick size, spread type, swap long/short, trading hours).

Commission schedules and swap rates.

Broker’s exact margin call / stop-out levels.

Broker error codes & requote/slippage policy.

Live execution latency benchmarks.

Action: Fill in the Excel/CSV Broker Data Template we built. Export MT4 “Specification” and “Account History” for each symbol.

2. Reentry Logic

What we have:

Reentry v1 (“six-sided die”).

Reentry v2 (dimension-extensible matrix with hashed IDs, JSON backing, versioning).

Gap:

Confirm which version is operational today (Matrix v2 or hybrid).

Provide a current CSV/JSON of the reentry matrix actually used in the EA.

Action: Export current matrix config from your system; mark v1 as legacy if no longer in use.

3. Security & Audit Controls

What we have:

Design-level requirements for JWT, RBAC, tamper-evident audit logs.

mTLS and certificate rotation guidance in the v3.x chat patches.

Gap:

Mapping to Forex.com portal & MT4 reality (what auth layers exist beyond MT4 password?).

Audit log retention settings (MT4 log rollover vs SQLite backup policies).

Action: Document actual security controls from broker + server. Decide retention schedule (e.g. 90 days) and implement in SQLite + file backups.

4. Deployment & Ops

What we have:

Technical manuals (v1.0 Excel-based, v1.1 Python-only).

SRS ops section references Excel dashboards.

Gap:

Ops runbook: how to deploy EA + Python bridge on a fresh VPS.

Monitoring & escalation: who gets alerts, how fast, in what format.

Failover plan: what happens if broker server goes down.

Action: Write a short ops runbook (deployment steps, alert routing, escalation contacts).

5. Testing & Validation

What we have:

SRS requires simulation, mock interfaces, latency test suites.

No test evidence included.

Gap:

No validation reports proving SLOs (e.g., socket <10ms, drawdown breaker works).

No captured logs/screenshots from simulation mode.

Action: Run regression in sim mode; export logs. Produce “Test Evidence Pack.”

📋 Roadmap Summary Table
Area	Status	Next Step
Broker Data	Partially covered (generic MT4)	Fill Broker Template with MT4 exports (symbol specs, swaps, commission)
Reentry Logic	Both v1 and v2 exist	Confirm live version; export JSON/CSV of matrix
Security & Audit	Designed in docs	Map to broker reality; define retention policy
Deployment & Ops	Manuals exist, outdated	Write ops runbook; update monitoring/escalation
Testing & Validation	Requirements defined	Generate evidence logs; build Test Pack

👉 Suggestion: once you collect the broker exports and confirm the reentry matrix version, I can stitch those directly into the Comprehensive Tactical Spec and produce a v3.6 Master Spec.

Would you like me to also draft a “Test Evidence Pack” template (structured Markdown/Excel) so you can drop in screenshots and logs from your first validation run?

You said:
what do they do
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 50s

Here’s what each part of the project does—super short and practical:

Core app (src/)

dde_client.py – Opens the DDE pipe to MT4, subscribes to symbols, pulls bid/ask ticks, and manages reconnects.

price_manager.py – Stores incoming ticks per symbol, builds rolling buffers / OHLC aggregates, validates spreads, and serves “latest” data to everything else.

indicator_engine.py – Registers indicators per symbol, feeds them new prices, caches their outputs, and exposes “get value(s)” for the UI.

ui_components.py – Tkinter widgets/panels: connection controls, symbol table, indicator table, charts, stats.

main_tab.py – The main Tkinter app frame: tabs (Live Prices / Indicators / Charts / Stats), wires buttons to start/stop monitoring, add/remove symbols and indicators.

config_manager.py – Loads/saves settings (refresh rates, symbols, indicator presets), validates, and provides a small config dialog.

error_handler.py – Central error & performance layer: logs, circuit breakers, auto-recovery hooks, function timing, CPU/memory watchers.

Indicators (indicators/)

base_indicator.py – Abstract base + performance tracking + history buffers + a factory to create indicators by type.

moving_averages.py – SMA/EMA/WMA/HMA/SMMA implementations.

oscillators.py – RSI, Stochastic, MACD, Williams %R, CCI implementations and helpers (e.g., overbought/oversold checks).

volatility.py – Bollinger Bands, ATR, StdDev, Keltner Channels, Volatility Index + utility classifiers.

Config (config/)

settings.json – App defaults (DDE server name, update rates, default symbols, preset indicators).

symbols.json – Known symbols with display text and precision (digits).

Tests (tests/)

test_dde_connection.py – Unit/integration tests for connecting, subscribing, callbacks, reconnection.

test_indicators.py – Verifies math for all indicators (ranges, structure, edge cases).

run_all_tests.py – One-shot test runner with smoke tests and JSON report.

Entry point & docs

run_application.py – Launches the GUI (dependency checks, logging setup).

README.md – How to install, run, architecture overview.

requirements.txt – Pip dependencies.

How they work together (flow)

MT4 (DDE) → dde_client.py (ticks) → price_manager.py (buffers/ohlc) → indicator_engine.py (compute) → ui_components.py/main_tab.py (render + controls).
config_manager.py feeds settings to all; error_handler.py guards stability; tests validate DDE + indicators.

If you want, I can sketch a minimal sequence diagram or show exactly where to plug in your percent-change windows and currency-strength calc in price_manager.py + indicator_engine.py.

You said:
They could already do this:



I need to set up the DDE an indicator system and tab in the GIU. the core is gonna circle center around the DBE import from MT4. that's going to create the currency strength indicator and percent change relative to calculations I want the percent change in the various pairs that are imported by the DDE at minimum I need change within the last 15 minutes last hour last 4 hours 8 hours 12 hours in 24 hours I need to know that for each individual currency pair that is bent over in the EE as well as I need to know these percent changes in the currency strength indicator the DDE will serve as the main price fee for the other indicators and signals from the price to rise signal category Does that make sense

ChatGPT said:
Thought for a second
Thought for 1m 2s

Yes—makes sense. Here’s a concrete, drop-in plan (with code you can paste) to add:

rolling %-change windows per pair (15m, 1h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h)

a currency-strength table computed from those pair moves

a new GUI tab to show both

I’m assuming the tick source is your existing DDE client and PriceManager is your central store.

1) Price history + percent-change windows (in price_manager.py)

Add a compact rolling store per symbol and a helper that returns % changes for standard windows. Uses mid price ((bid+ask)/2) and prunes old points on the fly.

2) Currency Strength calculation (new file currency_strength.py)

A lightweight service that consumes your PriceManager and aggregates the pair %-changes into per-currency strength numbers. Convention: for pair BASE/QUOTE, the pair % change contributes +change to BASE and −change to QUOTE. We average across all available pairs per window.

3) GUI tab: “Strength & % Change” (in ui_components.py + main_tab.py)

A new tab with two tables:

Top: pairs with % change columns

Bottom: currency strength with the same windows

3a) Add a reusable table widget (if you don’t have one yet)
# --- ui_components.py additions ---

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk

class PercentChangeTable(ttk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, master, title: str, columns: list[str], **kwargs):
        super().__init__(master, **kwargs)
        ttk.Label(self, text=title, font=("Segoe UI", 11, "bold")).pack(anchor="w", pady=(0,4))
        self._tree = ttk.Treeview(self, columns=columns, show="headings", height=10)
        for col in columns:
            self._tree.heading(col, text=col)
            self._tree.column(col, width=90, anchor="e")
        self._tree.column(columns[0], width=120, anchor="w")  # first column wider for name

        for r in rows:

            values = [name] + [f"{r.get(k,''):,.2f}%" if isinstance(r.get(k), (int,float)) else ""

                self._tree.item(self._rows[name], values=values)
            else:
                iid = self._tree.insert("", "end", values=values)
                self._rows[name] = iid

        # optionally remove stale
        for name in list(self._rows.keys()):
            if name not in seen:
                self._tree.delete(self._rows[name])
                del self._rows[name]

3b) Wire a new tab and a refresh loop

In your main app (where tabs are created), add:

# --- main_tab.py additions (inside your DDEPriceImportApp init/build_ui) ---

from ui_components import PercentChangeTable
from currency_strength import compute_currency_strength
from datetime import datetime

def _fmt_cols():
    return ["Name","15m","1h","4h","8h","12h","24h"]

def _make_strength_tab(self):
    tab = ttk.Frame(self.notebook)
    self.notebook.add(tab, text="Strength & % Change")

    # top: pairs
    self.pairs_table = PercentChangeTable(tab, "Pair % Change", _fmt_cols())
    self.pairs_table.pack(fill="both", expand=True, padx=8, pady=(8,4))

    # bottom: currencies
    self.ccy_table = PercentChangeTable(tab, "Currency Strength (avg of pair moves)", _fmt_cols())
    self.ccy_table.pack(fill="both", expand=True, padx=8, pady=(4,8))

    # kick off periodic refresh
    self._refresh_strength_tab()
    return tab

def _collect_pair_rows(self):
    rows = []
    for sym in self.price_manager.get_available_symbols():
        changes = self.price_manager.get_percent_changes(sym)  # {'15m': x, ...}
        row = {'name': sym}
        row.update(changes)
        rows.append(row)
    return rows

def _collect_ccy_rows(self):
    strength = compute_currency_strength(self.price_manager)   # {'USD': {...}, ...}
    rows = []
    for ccy, changes in strength.items():
        row = {'name': ccy}
        row.update(changes)
        rows.append(row)
    return rows

def _refresh_strength_tab(self):
    try:
        if hasattr(self, "pairs_table"):
            self.pairs_table.update_rows(self._collect_pair_rows())
        if hasattr(self, "ccy_table"):
            self.ccy_table.update_rows(self._collect_ccy_rows())
    finally:
        # refresh every 1s (or tie to your UI refresh config)
        self.root.after(1000, self._refresh_strength_tab)


Call _make_strength_tab() where you build the notebook tabs (right after your existing “Indicators/Charts/Stats” tabs are created).

4) Where the data flows

DDE tick → add_price_tick(symbol, {'bid','ask','timestamp'})

PriceManager stores (ts, mid) and exposes get_percent_changes(symbol)

compute_currency_strength(price_manager) reads those % changes and aggregates per currency

New GUI tab calls these every second and renders the tables

5) Notes & sensible defaults

Uses mid price to avoid spread noise. If you prefer bid or last, switch _get_mid().

Windows are fixed; you can expose them in settings.json later.

Strength is a simple average across all visible pairs per currency/window. You can weight by liquidity or inverse volatility if you want finer control.

If your PriceManager already has OHLC aggregations, you can swap _price_at_or_before for bar lookups (faster at scale).

6) Quick smoke check (pseudo)

Once pasted:

# after ticks stream in for ~a minute, in a REPL attached to the app:
pm.get_percent_changes("EURUSD")
# -> {'15m': ..., '1h': ..., '4h': ...}

import currency_strength as cs
cs.compute_currency_strength(pm)
# -> {'USD': {'15m': ...}, 'EUR': {...}, ...}


If you want, I can also emit these as ready-to-drop files (or a patch bundle) and include a tiny test that fakes ticks over 24h so you can validate the math without MT4.

You said:
Can you help me brainstorm a way to use currency strength indicators for each currency and build an oscillator type indicator that identifies overbought and oversold but based on the values derived from the currency strength indicator I'm trying to develop ways to use currency strength similar to price create indicators
ChatGPT said:
Thought for a second
Thought for 29s

Absolutely—let’s turn “currency strength” into a family of oscillator-style indicators you can compute, visualize, and signal on (just like price-based RSI/Stoch/MACD), but driven by strength values per currency.

Below is a clear plan plus drop-in indicator designs that fit your existing BaseIndicator/MultiValueIndicator framework.

0) Inputs recap (what we’ll feed these with)

You already have pair %-changes over time windows (15m, 1h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h).

From those, you can maintain a per-currency strength time series, e.g. S_USD[t], S_EUR[t], … where each sample is a scalar at time t.

Typical construction (simple): for pair BASE/QUOTE, add +Δ% to BASE and −Δ% to QUOTE, average across all pairs touching that currency at time t.

Optionally weight pairs (e.g., liquidity/volatility/session weights).

We’ll treat each S_CCY[t] as if it were a “price” series, and then apply oscillator math to it.

1) Pick one canonical strength series per currency

You have two common choices (you can support both; select at runtime):

A. Rolling Δ% (flow-sensitive)

At every tick/bar, update the multi-horizon table.

Compute a single composite strength per currency as a weighted sum of horizons:

S_CCY[t] = Σ (w_h * Δ%_h_CCY[t]), e.g., w = {15m:0.4, 1h:0.3, 4h:0.2, 24h:0.1}.

B. Index (level-sensitive)

Build a normalized strength index that drifts slowly:

S_CCY[t] = α * S_CCY[t-1] + (1−α) * (Σ pairs contributions at t) (EMA filter).

Optionally rescale to [0, 100] each update via min-max or percentile (see §2).

For oscillators, either is fine. A tends to be more “snappy”, B smoother.

2) Normalize the strength series before oscillating

Oscillators behave better with normalized inputs. Choose one:

Z-score: Z[t] = (S[t] – mean_{N}) / stdev_{N}
Overbought/Oversold (OB/OS) bands: ±1.0/±2.0.

Percent Rank (robust): rank S[t] in rolling window N → value in [0,100].
OB/OS bands: >80 / <20.

Min–Max scale over rolling window N to [0,100].
OB/OS bands: >80 / <20.

I recommend Percent Rank for robustness and intuitive banding.

3) Oscillator types (built on the normalized strength)

You can implement all as standard indicators over S_CCY[t]:

3.1 StrengthRSI (RSI on strength)

Compute RSI on S_CCY[t] values (or on normalized Z[t]).

Signals:

OB if RSI > 70/80, OS if RSI < 30/20.

Crosses of 50 line (momentum shifts).

Divergence vs the pair price (optional advanced).

3.2 StrengthStochastic (Stoch on strength)

%K from where current S[t] sits between rolling min/max in window N.

%D = SMA of %K.

Signals:

%K crossing %D above 80 (potential weakening from strong extreme).

%K crossing %D below 20 (potential strengthening from weak extreme).

3.3 StrengthMACD (MACD on strength)

MACD of S[t] (EMA fast/slow + signal line).

Signals: MACD–Signal crossovers; histogram expansion/contraction.

3.4 Differential oscillator for a pair (base minus quote)

For the selected pair BASE/QUOTE, compute:

D[t] = S_BASE[t] – S_QUOTE[t]
Then apply any oscillator (RSI/Stoch/MACD) to D[t]. This is extremely actionable:

If D[t] is strongly positive and overbought (e.g., RSI>70), BASE/QUOTE might be stretched up.

If strongly negative and oversold, stretched down.

3.5 StrengthZScore bands

Keep Z[t] with rolling μ/σ.

Signals: Z[t] > +2 (stretched strong), < -2 (stretched weak).

Reversion cues on cross back inside ±1.

3.6 StrengthPercentRank

PR[t] ∈ [0,100] from rolling window.

Signals: PR>90 (extreme strength), PR<10 (extreme weakness).

“Squeeze” detection: BB on PR[t] bandwidth low, breakout when PR’s BB breaches.

4) Drop-in indicator classes (plug into your framework)
4.1 A tiny strength feed adapter

You’ll maintain one StrengthFeed object that your oscillators can query.

# strength_feed.py
from collections import deque
from typing import Dict, Deque, Tuple

class StrengthFeed:
    """
    Holds per-currency strength time series like a 'price' series:
      series['USD'] = deque([(ts, value), ...], maxlen=MAX)
    Your updater will call add_point(ccy, ts, strength_value).

Wire these into your IndicatorFactory if you want factory creation by type.

5) Practical signal recipes (ready-to-trade rules)
5.1 Mean-reversion (single currency)

Use StrengthZScore(currency='JPY', window=50).

Short JPY baskets when Z > +2 and crosses back below +2.
Long JPY baskets when Z < −2 and crosses back above −2.

5.2 Differential momentum (pair-focused)

Use StrengthStochastic(base='EUR', quote='USD', k=14, d=3).

For EURUSD:

Long when %K < 20 then crosses up %D (oversold → up) and slope of D[t] positive.

Short when %K > 80 then crosses down %D (overbought → down).

5.3 Trend continuation (MACD on differential)

Compute D[t] = S_BASE − S_QUOTE, run MACD(12,26,9).

Enter in direction of MACD–Signal cross, filter with ZScore not at extremes (avoid “late tops”).

5.4 Breadth / consensus strength filter

For each window (e.g., 1h), count how many pairs support the sign of S_BASE − S_QUOTE.

Trade only when breadth ≥ threshold (e.g., ≥3 confirming pairs), reduces false signals.

6) UI ideas (fast to add)

Strength Heatmap (currencies × windows): color-by value or z-score; click any cell to open a StrengthRSI and StrengthStoch panel for that currency.

Pair Panel shows:

Top: price chart

Bottom: D[t] Stoch RSI or ZScore with bands (20/80 or ±2)

Side: mini heatmap of component currencies

7) Testing & validation

Synthetic feed: push a sinusoid + noise into StrengthFeed to ensure oscillators hit OB/OS at expected cycles.

Edge cases: flat periods (std=0), missing pairs, thin data during off sessions → return None or neutral values.

Latency: all calc is O(window); keep windows modest (14–100). Your framework’s performance tracking will confirm.

TL;DR build order

Keep/finish your currency strength aggregator updating StrengthFeed.

Add StrengthRSI, StrengthStochastic, StrengthZScore (and optional StrengthMACD, Differential).

Expose configs in UI (choose currency OR base/quote).

Plot with standard OB/OS bands and wire alerts on crosses.

If you want, I can package these as complete files that slot into your indicators/ folder and a minimal UI panel (heatmap + dual oscillator) ready to paste.

I want to create a set of signals based on conditional probability in pip movement over a given time. Example historical when there is a ten pip move in less than 15 minutes the probability that as the next 3 hours elapse price will move another 25 pips in that same direction is x. I want to use historical data to find the highest values for x. And I want to apply that thinking to a range of fluctuating values. Alot of new traders use popular indicators can i use an indicator value or some mathematical transformation of thoses values to identify patterns. Does that make sense 
ChatGPT said:

Yes, what you're describing makes excellent sense—and it’s a powerful way to detect conditional momentum, volatility bursts, and continuation setups using empirical probability, not speculation.

Let’s break it down into what you’re trying to build and how to do it.

🧠 Your Objective in Plain Terms

Use historical intraday price behavior to calculate the conditional probability of price continuation, reversal, or range compression—after an observed setup, like a sudden pip move or an indicator event.

You want to know:

“When X happens, what’s the probability of Y within T minutes/hours?”

✅ Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. Define Your Trigger Events (Condition X)

These are observable setups or signals. Examples:

"Price moved ≥ 10 pips within 15 minutes"

"RSI crossed 70 with price up > 5 pips in last 10 minutes"

"Price breached Bollinger Band + closed outside it"

"ADX > 30 and MACD just crossed"

These become your signal conditions—and you’ll loop through historical bars to flag timestamps where these occur.

2. Define Your Outcome (Condition Y)

Once your condition is met, you want to check:

Did price move another X pips in the same direction within Y minutes?

Did price reverse by X pips?

Did price stay in a tight range?

These are measurable outcomes tied to your signal triggers. Think of this like target vs stop vs no trade.

3. Build a Historical Scanner (Python, Pandas)

Loop through your M1 or M5 data and:

Look for your setup condition.

For each setup, simulate a forward window (e.g., 3 hours).

Check: did your outcome happen?

Store the result as a (condition → outcome) mapping.

This gives you an empirical conditional probability distribution, like:

Condition: 10 pip up move in < 15 minutes
→ Outcome: 25 pip continuation in same direction within 3 hours
→ P = 0.63 (based on 824 historical matches)


This becomes a statistical signal.

📊 Example Use Cases
Setup Condition	Outcome	Probability
Price ↑ 12 pips in < 10 min	+25 pips in next 2 hours	68%
RSI crosses 30 & price down 5+ pips	+15 pip bounce in 1h	54%
MACD crosses up + ATR > 10	+20 pips within 3h	62%

You can later rank conditions by P(Y|X) to find the most predictive.

🧠 Can You Use Indicators for This?

Yes—and here’s how to use them correctly:

✔ Transform Indicators into “Event States”

Rather than using the raw indicator value, transform it into a signal condition. For example:

Indicator	Transformation
RSI	Crosses above 70 (overbought trigger)
Bollinger Bands	Price closes above upper band
MACD	MACD line crosses signal line up
ATR	ATR above rolling average (volatility regime)
Stochastics	K crossing D in oversold zone
✔ Combine with Price Behavior

You’ll likely get stronger probabilities when combining indicator logic + price logic:

e.g.,
“RSI crossed 70 and price made new 30-minute high”
→ “+30 pips in next 2 hours” = 72% historical probability.

📐 Signal Output You Can Build

Once you collect enough of these mappings, you can build a real-time signal engine that checks:

“Is any known condition X happening now?”

“What’s the historical outcome distribution?”

“Is expected move > cost (spread + volatility)?”

→ If yes, trigger a trade or alert.

📦 Toolchain You Can Use

Data: Tick or 1-minute OHLCV (Dukascopy, TrueFX, Darwinex)

Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy, ta-lib, statsmodels)

Storage: SQLite or CSV for signals

Visualization: Matplotlib / Plotly (for signal vs price path plots)

Integration: Push signals to MT4, TradingView, or Excel

💡 Bonus Ideas

Use KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) to smooth conditional probabilities.

Use unsupervised clustering to group similar price bursts.

Use entropy or information gain to rank setups.

Filter signals by market regime (low/high vol, trend vs range).

🚦Next Steps for You

Pick 1 simple setup like "Price moves 10+ pips in 15 min".

Write a backtester to check outcomes in a forward window.

Store results as (Condition → Outcome → P).

Start building a table of top setups by P(success).

Expand to include indicator-derived setups.

Thought for 2m 6s

Totally makes sense—and you can 100% turn that idea into a repeatable, data-driven signal engine. Here’s a tight blueprint that fits your repo and gives you actionable next steps.

The blueprint
1) Define the “trigger” X (what just happened)

Examples (parametrized so you can scan lots of combos):

Burst: “price moved ≥ M pips within W minutes” (e.g., M∈{8,10,12,15}, W∈{5,10,15}).
Use your minute bars from the built-in OHLC aggregator (M1/M5/… are already available via get_ohlc_data(symbol, timeframe, count)), so you get clean, time-boxed moves rather than tick noise.

Indicator state filters (optional): e.g., RSI decile, MACD histogram sign, %B bucket, ATR regime. You already have these indicators available (RSI, MACD in oscillators; Bollinger Bands, ATR in volatility), so they’re easy to compute on the same bars.

Tip: compute pip size per symbol (e.g., 0.0001 for most, 0.01 for JPY) from your symbol metadata so “10 pips” is precise.

2) Define the “outcome” Y (what happens next)

For each trigger, test outcomes on forward windows (e.g., 30m, 1h, 3h):

Continuation: “+K pips further in same direction within T” (e.g., K∈{10,15,20,25}, T∈{30m,60m,180m}).

Reversal: “−K pips in opposite direction within T.”

Range compression: “max excursion < R pips within T.”

This gives you P(Y|X) for many X definitions.

3) Offline scanner (build the probability table)

Pull M1 bars for a long sample (12–24 months if you have them) via PriceManager → get_ohlc_data(symbol, 'M1', N).

Roll through time; at each bar:

Check if any trigger X just occurred (burst threshold, optional indicator states).

Look ahead T minutes (no peeking past each bar’s timestamp) and score outcomes Y.

Aggregate counts to compute P(Y|X)=success/total, store N (sample size), plus EV (expected move) and time-to-target stats.

Practical stats:

Laplace smoothing (e.g., add α=1 to success/failure) to stabilize tiny buckets.

Track confidence via Wilson/Beta intervals so you can suppress low-N signals.

4) Real-time signal engine

Wire this into your existing indicator pipeline:

On each new M1 close, evaluate burst triggers + indicator states, build a “state key”, and look it up in the probability table.

Emit a record like: {prob_continuation, sample_size, expected_move_pips, median_ttt, state_descriptor}.

Gate by minimum samples (e.g., N≥200) and minimum probability edge (e.g., P≥0.60) before raising a signal.

This fits neatly next to your current IndicatorEngine callback flow (engine already initializes indicators with history and notifies update callbacks), so you can surface the signal to the UI the same way you surface RSI/MACD, etc.

5) Use “popular indicator” values as states (your question)

Absolutely. Don’t trade the raw values—bucketize them into states so you can learn P(Y|X) by state:

RSI: deciles (0–10,10–20,…,90–100) or zones (<30,30–70,>70).

MACD: histogram sign (+/−) and magnitude buckets.

Bollinger: %B deciles; Bandwidth bucket for volatility regime.

ATR: relative ATR = ATR/price into regimes (very low/low/med/high).

You can also add your Currency Strength (CSI) as a state:

Compute per-currency strength (avg normalized returns across all pairs containing that currency).

For a pair A/B, include ΔStrength = Strength(A) − Strength(B).

Bucket ΔStrength (e.g., deciles or z-score bands) and learn P(Y|X, ΔS bucket).

Build an oscillator on CSI: z-score the strength line over N bars; “overbought/oversold” = ±Z thresholds. This gives you a strength-based OB/OS that’s less price-anchored and more cross-sectional.

6) UI/UX

Add a “Conditional Edge” table per symbol:

Columns: Trigger, State(s), P(continue), N, EV(pips), Med TTT, Last seen.
Populate via your normal indicator update callback so it refreshes live. (Your UI components already list indicators with config/status; reuse that pattern for this signal set.)

Pseudocode you can drop in
# 1) Build the probability table from M1 history
def scan_probabilities(bars, pip_size, burst_pips_grid, burst_win_grid, fwd_pips_grid, fwd_win_grid, state_fn):
    # bars: list of (time, open, high, low, close)
    stats = {}  # key -> {'succ':0,'tot':0, ...}
    closes = [b.close for b in bars]

    for i in range(len(bars)):
        # compute states from indicators/CSI using history up to i
        state_key = state_fn(closes[:i+1])  # returns a tuple, e.g., ('RSI_decile:7','MACD:pos','ATR:low')

        for M in burst_pips_grid:
            for W in burst_win_grid:
                j = idx_of_time(bars, bars[i].time - minutes(W))
                if j is None or j >= i: 
                    continue
                move = (closes[i] - closes[j]) / pip_size
                direction = 1 if move >= M else (-1 if move <= -M else 0)
                if direction == 0: 
                    continue  # no trigger

                for K in fwd_pips_grid:
                    for T in fwd_win_grid:
                        k_end = idx_of_time(bars, bars[i].time + minutes(T))
                        if k_end is None:
                            continue
                        fwd_max = max(closes[i+1:k_end+1]) if direction>0 else min(closes[i+1:k_end+1])
                        reached = ( (fwd_max - closes[i]) / pip_size >= K ) if direction>0 else ( (closes[i] - fwd_max) / pip_size >= K )
                        key = (f"M≥{M}@{W}m", f"→{K}@{T}", direction, state_key)
                        stats.setdefault(key, {'succ':0,'tot':0})
                        stats[key]['tot'] += 1
                        stats[key]['succ'] += int(reached)

    # finalize with probabilities and filters
    table = []
    for key, v in stats.items():
        succ, tot = v['succ'], v['tot']
        p = (succ + 1) / (tot + 2)  # Laplace α=1
        table.append({'key': key, 'p': p, 'n': tot})
    return table


Hook this into your pipeline by:

Pulling M1 bars from PriceManager for each symbol.

Computing indicator states using your existing classes (RSI/MACD/BB/ATR).

Saving the resulting table (CSV/SQLite).

At runtime, generate a state_key from the latest bars/CS oscillator and look up the best row(s).

Guardrails (important)

No look-ahead: only use info up to the trigger bar when defining X.

Overlapping triggers: allow but don’t double-count the same event for the same window if you want independence.

Session effects: condition on hour-of-day or “London/NY open” flags; probabilities vary a lot by session.

Vol regime: always include an ATR or bandwidth bucket; burst behavior in low-vol vs high-vol is very different.

Sample size: enforce n_min (e.g., 200) and show confidence intervals in the UI.

Quick next steps

Choose your first trigger grid (e.g., M∈{10,15}, W∈{10,15}; K∈{15,25}; T∈{60,180}).

Run the scanner on 6–12 months of M1 per symbol.

Rank by p with n≥200; keep the top 10–20 rows per symbol.

Add a small “Conditional Edge” panel in the GUI to show the live, best-matching row for the current state.

Add your Currency-Strength z-oscillator and include its bucket as a state.

If you want, I can draft a drop-in conditional_signals.py that plugs into IndicatorEngine and emits {prob, n, EV} on each M1 close, plus a tiny UI table widget to display it—just say the word and I’ll scaffold it to match your code style.

show a live “Conditional Edge” panel in the GUI

1) Choose your first trigger grid

In your analysis script or a quick notebook:

import pandas as pd
from conditional_signals import TriggerGrid, ScanParams, ProbabilityScanner, top_rows_by_prob, state_none, state_rsi_bucket, pip_size_for_symbol

# Example grid (you can expand later)
grid = TriggerGrid(
    burst_pips=(10, 15),          # M ∈ {10,15} pips burst
    burst_window_min=(10, 15),    # W ∈ {10,15} minutes
    fwd_pips=(15, 25),            # K ∈ {15,25} pips forward target
    fwd_window_min=(60, 180)      # T ∈ {60m,180m}
)

symbol = "EURUSD"
pip = pip_size_for_symbol(symbol, digits=5)  # or provide exact pip size
scanner = ProbabilityScanner(state_fn=state_rsi_bucket)  # or state_none for no indicator states


You can swap state_rsi_bucket for state_none (no states) or write your own state function (e.g. include ATR/Bollinger/CSI buckets).

2) Run the scanner on 6–12 months of M1 per symbol

Assuming you have CSV of M1 bars with columns time,open,high,low,close:

# Load M1 bars (use as much history as you have)
bars = pd.read_csv("EURUSD_M1.csv")  # you can switch to your own loader from your DB
params = ScanParams(symbol=symbol, pip_size=pip, grid=grid, min_samples=200)

table = scanner.scan_symbol(bars, params)
table.to_csv(f"{symbol}_conditional_table.csv", index=False)

# Inspect top rows by probability with n≥200
top = top_rows_by_prob(table, symbol=symbol, n_top=20, n_min=200)
top.head(20)


Repeat per symbol (loop through your universe and concatenate the tables).

Notes:

The scan enforces no look-ahead by only testing completed forward windows in history.

It computes P(Y|X) with Laplace smoothing (α=1) and keeps succ, tot, and p.

3) Rank by p with n≥200 (keep top 10–20 rows)

You already saw it above:

from conditional_signals import top_rows_by_prob
ranked = top_rows_by_prob(table, symbol="EURUSD", n_top=20, n_min=200)


Save this ranking per symbol (CSV or SQLite). These are your playbook rows.

4) Add a “Conditional Edge” panel in the GUI (live best match)
4a) Drop in the UI widget

Add this new file to your project (already generated):

ui_conditional_edge.py → provides ConditionalEdgePanel (Tkinter Treeview + live “best match” header)

4b) Load your precomputed table at app start

In your main app (where you build the notebook tabs), do something like:

# main_tab.py (or wherever you build the UI)
import pandas as pd
from ui_conditional_edge import ConditionalEdgePanel
from conditional_signals import best_match_live, top_rows_by_prob

# ... in your DDEPriceImportApp.build_ui() (after notebook exists)
self.cond_tab = ttk.Frame(self.notebook)
self.notebook.add(self.cond_tab, text="Conditional Edge")

self.cond_panel = ConditionalEdgePanel(self.cond_tab)
self.cond_panel.pack(fill="both", expand=True)

# Load your saved probability table(s). You can merge multiple symbols into one table.
self.cond_table = pd.read_csv("EURUSD_conditional_table.csv", converters={"state": eval})
# Filter + show the top ranked rows for the active symbol
symbol = "EURUSD"
top = top_rows_by_prob(self.cond_table, symbol=symbol, n_top=20, n_min=200)
self.cond_panel.load_table(top)


If you saved state as tuples (recommended), use converters={"state": eval} to read them back.

4c) Live matching each minute

When a new M1 bar closes (or on your UI timer), detect whether the burst trigger just occurred and update the live best match:

from conditional_signals import best_match_live

def _detect_burst_trigger(symbol, pip_size, bars, grid):
    """
    Return (trigger_label, dir_label) if a burst condition fired on the latest bar,
    else None. This mirrors the training logic: compare the last close vs W-min ago.
    """
    df = bars.copy()
    df["time"] = pd.to_datetime(df["time"])
    df = df.set_index("time").sort_index()
    close = df["close"].to_numpy()
    idx = df.index

    if len(close) < 2:
        return None

    now_t = idx[-1]
    # Try windows in priority order (e.g., small W first)
    for W in sorted(grid.burst_window_min):
        j = int(idx.searchsorted(now_t - pd.Timedelta(minutes=W), side="left"))
        if j >= len(close)-1:
            continue
        diff_pips = (close[-1] - close[j]) / pip_size
        direction = "up" if diff_pips > 0 else ("down" if diff_pips < 0 else None)
        if direction is None:
            continue
        abs_move = abs(diff_pips)
        for M in sorted(grid.burst_pips):
            if abs_move >= M:
                return (f"M≥{M}@{W}m", direction)
    return None

def _update_conditional_edge(self, symbol):
    # You should have a rolling M1 DataFrame of recent bars for the symbol.
    bars = self.get_m1_bars(symbol)  # implement or reuse your PriceManager fetch
    trigger = _detect_burst_trigger(symbol, self.pip_size_map[symbol], bars, self.grid)
    if trigger:
        # Build current state_key the same way you did in training (or use empty tuple)
        from conditional_signals import state_rsi_bucket  # or your custom state
        df_hist = bars.set_index("time").sort_index().tail(200)
        state_key = state_rsi_bucket(df_hist)
        row = best_match_live(self.cond_table, symbol, observed_trigger=trigger, state_key=state_key, n_min=50)
        self.cond_panel.set_live_best(row)
    else:
        self.cond_panel.set_live_best(None)

# Call _update_conditional_edge() on a 60s timer or right after each M1 completion.


That gives you a live “best historical edge” readout whenever the current market just produced a burst, with matching direction, trigger label, state, and the empirical probability and sample size behind it.

Practical tips

Data source: Use your M1 backfill (CSV/SQLite) for scanning; the runtime can use your existing M1 aggregator.

Pip precision: Use your symbol metadata (digits) to compute pip_size_for_symbol exactly.

States (optional but powerful): start simple (RSI zones), then add ATR regimes, Bollinger %B deciles, session (LDN/NY), or Currency-Strength Z-score buckets.

Confidence: In live use, show p and n; you can gray out signals below n_min.

Avoid overlap double-counting (if you want): during scanning, you can skip counting back-to-back bursts for the same W to reduce correlation.

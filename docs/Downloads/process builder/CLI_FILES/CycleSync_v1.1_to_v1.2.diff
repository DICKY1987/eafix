+# CycleSync Technical Spec â€” v1.2 Addendum (Agentic DevOps Integration)
+
+This addendum describes **non-invasive** integrations to adopt a **parallel, agentic CLI workflow** while keeping CycleSync's core intact.
+
+## A. Objectives
+- Enable parallel development with **Claude Code, Aider, Cline, Gemini CLI, ChatGPT Agent**, and **GitHub Copilot**.
+- Maintain **tight version control** via branches, worktrees, pre-commit, and merge queue.
+- Ensure **repeatability** with a declarative job manifest and CI policies.
+
+## B. New Operational Files (Repo Root)
+- `.ai/workflows/agent_jobs.yaml` â€” Declarative jobs (tool, branch, worktree, tests).
+- `.ai/scripts/orchestrate.ps1` â€” Orchestrates rebase â†’ tool run â†’ tests â†’ auto-commit/push.
+- `.vscode/tasks.json` â€” VS Code tasks to launch jobs in parallel.
+- `.gitmessage.txt` â€” Enforced commit trailers (`Tool:`, `Job:`).
+- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` â€” Pre-commit, tests, coverage as required checks.
+
+## C. Branch & Worktree Conventions
+- One **branch/worktree per job**: `feat/ui-aider`, `fix/api-cline`, `refactor/core-claude`.
+- All agents run inside their worktree to avoid collisions.
+- Commits are **atomic** and **signed**; merge via **queue** only.
+
+## D. Quality Gates
+- **Pre-commit**: format, lint, type check, secrets scan.
+- **CI**: repeat the same checks; enforce coverage threshold.
+- **Commit policy**: commit on green tests (or time-boxed WIP with label).
+
+## E. Integration Points with CycleSync
+- **Build/Test Hooks**: orchestrator invokes CycleSyncâ€™s existing test commands.
+- **Docs/Specs**: ChatGPT/Gemini generate ADRs & specs â†’ committed to `docs/` via dedicated generator branches.
+- **Artifacts**: Any generated files managed by a single `gen/*` branch to avoid conflicts.
+
+## F. Rollback & Safety
+- Cline snapshots workspace; Git handles reverts.
+- Feature flags guard risky changes; gradual rollout via PRs.
+
+## G. Next Steps
+1. Add files in Section B.
+2. Configure branch protection & merge queue on `main`.
+3. Start with 2â€“3 jobs in parallel and expand as stable.

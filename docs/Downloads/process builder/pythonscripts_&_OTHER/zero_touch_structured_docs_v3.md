## Document 1: Zero-Touch Demo Workflow
**Source:** zero_touch_demo_workflow.md
**Format:** GHERKIN
**Rationale:** Contains step-by-step processes and conditional workflows ideal for Gherkin format

### Structured Output:
```gherkin
Feature: Zero-Touch Automation Demo Workflow

  Background:
    Given the Zero-Touch Automation Engine is initialized
    And task definitions exist in the watched directory
    And Claude synthesis service is available

  Scenario: Automated Task Definition and Synthesis
    Given task core file "task_core_vscode.json" exists
    And project context file "project_context_huey_p.json" exists
    When file watcher detects new task files
    Then Claude synthesis should be triggered automatically
    And assembled task JSON should be generated
    And dropper script should be created
    And runtime ID "HUEY_P_TSK_001_EXEC_a7b8c9d2" should be assigned

  Scenario: Universal Dropper Deployment with Full Automation
    Given Claude synthesis has completed successfully
    And dropper script "HUEY_P_TSK_001_EXEC_a7b8c9d2_install_vscode.ps1" exists
    When auto-execution is triggered
    And EnableTelemetry flag is set
    And AutoProceedOnSuccess flag is set
    Then VS Code download should start automatically
    And installation should proceed without user intervention
    And extensions should be installed automatically
    And project workspace should be created
    And validation tests should run automatically

  Scenario: Real-Time Telemetry and Intelligence Monitoring
    Given task execution is in progress
    And telemetry collection is enabled
    When download progress reaches 45%
    And installation completes in 38.2 seconds
    And extensions installation takes 134.5 seconds
    Then telemetry events should be logged
    And Claude should analyze performance in real-time
    And optimization opportunities should be identified
    And success probability should be calculated

  Scenario: Successful Task Completion with Auto-Orchestration
    Given VS Code installation has completed
    And all validation tests pass
    And execution time is 142.3 seconds
    When task completion is detected
    Then completion summary should be displayed
    And next task should be identified as "HUEY_P_TSK_002"
    And checkpoint should be created
    And progress should be updated to "Phase_0_Step_1_Complete"
    And auto-trigger countdown should begin

  Scenario: Self-Improvement Learning Loop
    Given task execution has completed successfully
    And telemetry data has been collected
    When learning analysis is triggered
    Then execution performance should be compared to estimates
    And beginner experience effectiveness should be evaluated
    And successful techniques should be identified
    And core task enhancements should be recommended
    And future task optimizations should be applied

  Scenario: Seamless Task Transition
    Given previous task completed successfully
    And auto-proceed timeout has elapsed
    When next task trigger is activated
    Then "HUEY_P_TSK_002_INSTALL_GIT" should be synthesized
    And learning optimizations should be applied
    And continuous workflow should proceed
    And system evolution should continue

  Scenario: Error Recovery and Self-Healing
    Given task execution encounters an error
    When error is detected by the system
    Then error classification should occur
    And appropriate recovery action should be taken
    And if recovery fails, escalation should occur
    And troubleshooting guidance should be provided
```

### Processing Notes:
- Converted step-by-step automation workflows into Given/When/Then scenarios
- Maintained the sequential flow while capturing conditional logic
- Preserved all automation triggers and responses

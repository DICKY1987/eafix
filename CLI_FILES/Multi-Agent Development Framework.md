Technical Architecture Document: Multi-Agent Development Framework
1.0 System Overview
1.1 Executive Summary
The Multi-Agent Development Framework is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI-powered development tools to create a cost-optimized, highly automated software development pipeline. The system leverages a combination of free-tier cloud services and local AI models to deliver enterprise-grade development capabilities while maintaining strict cost controls.
The framework operates on a "lane-based" development model where different aspects of software development (coding, quality assurance, security, documentation) run in parallel isolated environments, with intelligent routing of tasks to the most appropriate and cost-effective AI service.

2.0 Core Architecture
2.1 Architectural Principles
The system is built on four fundamental architectural principles:

Cost Optimization First: Every operation considers cost implications and automatically routes to the most economical solution
Parallel Isolation: Development tasks run in isolated git worktrees to prevent conflicts and enable parallel execution
Progressive Enhancement: Simple tasks use free services, complex tasks progressively unlock premium services
Fail-Safe Degradation: When premium services are unavailable, the system gracefully falls back to local alternatives

2.2 System Layers
2.2.1 User Interface Layer
The topmost layer provides multiple entry points for user interaction, supporting both command-line and IDE-based workflows. This layer translates user intentions into system commands while maintaining consistency across different interaction modes.
2.2.2 Orchestration & Control Layer
The brain of the system, responsible for intelligent decision-making, resource allocation, and workflow coordination. This layer determines the optimal execution strategy for each task based on complexity, cost, and available resources.
2.2.3 AI Service Integration Layer
A unified abstraction over heterogeneous AI services, providing consistent interfaces while managing service-specific protocols, authentication, and response formats. This layer enables seamless switching between services based on availability and cost constraints.
2.2.4 Version Control & Storage Layer
The foundation layer managing persistent state, configuration, and code artifacts through git worktrees and local storage systems. This layer ensures data consistency and provides rollback capabilities.
3.0 Core Components
3.1 Task Classification Engine
3.1.1 Purpose and Responsibilities
The Task Classification Engine analyzes incoming development tasks and categorizes them by complexity (simple, moderate, complex) to determine the appropriate AI service and execution strategy. It uses pattern matching and keyword analysis to assess task requirements and estimate resource consumption.
3.1.2 Input/Output Specifications

Inputs: Natural language task descriptions, file patterns, historical task data
Outputs: Complexity classification, recommended service selection, cost estimates, token projections

3.1.3 Component Interactions
The engine interfaces with the Quota Manager to check service availability and the Cost Analytics component to project expenses. It provides routing decisions to the Workflow Engine for execution.
3.2 Quota Management System
3.2.1 Purpose and Responsibilities
Tracks and enforces usage limits across all AI services, maintaining daily quotas and preventing overuse of premium services. The system implements a rolling window tracking mechanism with automatic reset capabilities based on service-specific schedules.
3.2.2 Input/Output Specifications

Inputs: Service usage events, quota configuration, reset schedules
Outputs: Usage statistics, availability status, warning triggers, fallback recommendations

3.2.3 Component Interactions
Continuously monitors service calls from the AI Integration Layer and provides real-time availability data to the Task Classification Engine. Triggers cost warnings through the User Interface Layer when thresholds are approached.
3.3 Git Worktree Lane Manager
3.3.1 Purpose and Responsibilities
Creates and manages isolated development environments (lanes) using git worktrees, enabling parallel development streams without conflicts. Each lane represents a specific development concern (coding, testing, security) with its own branch and tooling configuration.
3.3.2 Input/Output Specifications

Inputs: Lane definitions, branch strategies, file patterns, commit policies
Outputs: Isolated worktree environments, branch management, merge coordination

3.3.3 Component Interactions
Coordinates with the Workflow Engine to execute tasks in appropriate lanes and manages the integration process when lanes need to be merged back to the main branch.
3.4 Workflow Execution Engine
3.4.1 Purpose and Responsibilities
Orchestrates complex multi-step workflows with conditional logic, error handling, and state persistence. The engine supports parallel execution, dependency management, and automatic rollback on failure.
3.4.2 Input/Output Specifications

Inputs: Workflow definitions (YAML), task parameters, execution context
Outputs: Execution results, state updates, error reports, rollback triggers

3.4.3 Component Interactions
Receives task assignments from the Task Classification Engine, executes them through the AI Service Integration Layer, and persists state through the Storage Layer.
3.5 AI Service Abstraction Layer
3.5.1 Purpose and Responsibilities
Provides a unified interface for interacting with diverse AI services (Gemini, Claude, Aider, Ollama) while handling service-specific protocols, authentication, and response normalization.
3.5.2 Input/Output Specifications

Inputs: Standardized task requests, service selection, execution parameters
Outputs: Normalized responses, file modifications, execution logs, cost metrics

3.5.3 Component Interactions
Receives execution requests from the Workflow Engine, reports usage to the Quota Manager, and returns results for persistence in the Storage Layer.
4.0 Data Flow Architecture
4.1 Primary Task Execution Flow
The system follows a sophisticated multi-stage data flow pattern:

Task Ingestion: User submits a development task through CLI or IDE interface
Classification: Task Classification Engine analyzes the request and determines complexity
Resource Allocation: Quota Manager checks service availability and reserves capacity
Lane Assignment: Git Worktree Manager allocates appropriate development lane
Workflow Initialization: Workflow Engine loads relevant workflow definition
Service Selection: Based on complexity and availability, optimal AI service is selected
Execution: AI service processes the task in isolated environment
Validation: Quality gates and security scans verify the output
Persistence: Results are committed to git and state is persisted
Integration: Changes are merged back through the integration pipeline

4.2 Cost Optimization Flow
A parallel flow continuously optimizes for cost:

Usage Monitoring: Real-time tracking of service consumption
Threshold Detection: Warning triggers when approaching limits
Fallback Activation: Automatic switch to free alternatives
Cost Projection: Continuous calculation of daily and monthly costs
Optimization Recommendations: Suggestions for task decomposition to reduce costs

5.0 Operational Mechanics
5.1 Initialization and Bootstrap Process
5.1.1 Framework Initialization
The system initializes by creating the necessary directory structures, git repositories, and worktree lanes. Configuration files are validated and local AI models are prepared for offline operation.
5.1.2 Service Discovery
On startup, the system queries all configured AI services to determine availability, checks API keys, and establishes baseline quotas for the current period.
5.2 Task Execution Lifecycle
5.2.1 Research-Plan-Code Pattern
Complex tasks follow a three-phase execution pattern:

Research Phase: Free-tier services gather information and context
Planning Phase: Premium services (when justified) create architectural designs
Implementation Phase: Local or free services generate the actual code

5.2.2 Test-Driven Development Workflow
The system supports automated TDD patterns where AI agents first generate tests, verify they fail appropriately, then implement solutions to pass the tests.
5.3 Integration and Deployment Pipeline
5.3.1 Lane Merge Strategy
Development lanes are merged in a predetermined order based on dependency relationships, with quality and security lanes typically processing after implementation lanes.
5.3.2 Validation Gates
Each merge triggers automated validation including syntax checking, test execution, security scanning, and performance benchmarking before allowing progression.
5.4 Error Handling and Recovery
5.4.1 Failure Detection
The system monitors for execution failures, quota exhaustion, and service unavailability, triggering appropriate recovery mechanisms.
5.4.2 Rollback Mechanisms
Failed operations automatically trigger git-based rollback to the last known good state, with optional manual intervention points for complex failures.
5.5 Monitoring and Observability
5.5.1 Metrics Collection
The system continuously collects metrics on task execution time, service usage, cost accumulation, and success rates.
5.5.2 Performance Analytics
Analytics components process collected metrics to identify optimization opportunities, usage patterns, and potential bottlenecks.

The user should not be able to set the position size directly. User should set global risk parameter that is a percentage of account value. There should be a standard risk of loss per trade for example, letâs say 3%. All position sizing then is calculated from that there should be a parameter for risk adjustment that will allow the traitor to it or negative multiplier to the standard risk amount and that change and risk percentage loss relative to the account balance then determines the position size there needs to be a cap as well for the risk of loss portrayed and that needs to be 3.5% maximum that can be risk on any one trade thatâs for the original trade in all entries we want to take the ability for the user to set position size and and create a situation where the user must focus on the potential risk

Edit
Revised Position Sizing System - Risk-Based Only
You're absolutely right! Direct position sizing creates dangerous situations. Here's the corrected risk-based system:

1. REMOVED PARAMETERS (No longer available to users)
python
# REMOVED - Users can no longer set these directly
# lot_size: float                 # REMOVED
# max_lot_size: float            # REMOVED  
# min_lot_size: float            # REMOVED
# position_sizing_method: str    # REMOVED (always risk-based now)
2. NEW REQUIRED RISK PARAMETERS
global_risk_percent (Decimal number, REQUIRED)
Description: The standard percentage of your account you're willing to lose on each trade. This is your baseline risk level that all position sizes are calculated from. Example: 3.0 means you're willing to risk 3% of your account on each trade Range: 0.1% to 3.5% maximum Default: None (must be set by user)

risk_adjustment_multiplier (Decimal number, default: 1.0)
Description: Adjusts the risk up or down from your global risk percentage. Multiply your global risk by this number to get the actual risk for this parameter set. Examples:

1.0 = Use exactly the global risk (3% Ã 1.0 = 3%)
0.5 = Use half the global risk (3% Ã 0.5 = 1.5%)
1.2 = Use 20% more risk (3% Ã 1.2 = 3.6% - but capped at 3.5%) Range: 0.1 to 1.17 maximum (to prevent exceeding 3.5% cap)
max_risk_cap_percent (Decimal number, SYSTEM ENFORCED: 3.5)
Description: The absolute maximum percentage of account that can be risked on any single trade. This is a hard limit that cannot be exceeded regardless of calculations. Value: Always 3.5% - cannot be changed by user Purpose: Safety limit to prevent catastrophic losses

3. CALCULATED POSITION SIZE PARAMETERS (Read-only)
calculated_lot_size (Decimal number, READ-ONLY)
Description: The actual lot size that will be used for trades, automatically calculated based on your risk settings, account balance, and stop loss distance. Formula: (Account Balance Ã Actual Risk %) Ã· (Stop Loss Pips Ã Pip Value) Updated: Automatically recalculated before each trade

actual_risk_percent (Decimal number, READ-ONLY)
Description: The final risk percentage being used after applying the risk adjustment multiplier and safety caps. Formula: MIN(global_risk_percent Ã risk_adjustment_multiplier, 3.5%) Example: If global_risk_percent = 3.0% and risk_adjustment_multiplier = 1.3, then actual_risk_percent = 3.5% (capped)

risk_amount_dollars (Decimal number, READ-ONLY)
Description: The actual dollar amount being risked on each trade. Formula: Account Balance Ã actual_risk_percent Example: $10,000 account Ã 3.0% = $300 risked per trade

8. EXAMPLE RISK CALCULATIONS
Example 1: Conservative Setup
python
# Account Balance: $10,000
# Global Risk: 2.0%
# Risk Adjustment: 0.8 (conservative)
# Stop Loss: 50 pips

actual_risk_percent = 2.0% Ã 0.8 = 1.6%
risk_amount_dollars = $10,000 Ã 1.6% = $160
# If EURUSD pip value = $1 per 0.01 lot:
lot_size = $160 Ã· (50 pips Ã $1) = 3.2 Ã 0.01 = 0.032 lots
Example 2: Aggressive Setup
python
# Account Balance: $10,000  
# Global Risk: 3.0%
# Risk Adjustment: 1.15 (aggressive)
# Stop Loss: 30 pips

raw_risk = 3.0% Ã 1.15 = 3.45%
actual_risk_percent = 3.45% (within 3.5% cap)
risk_amount_dollars = $10,000 Ã 3.45% = $345
lot_size = $345 Ã· (30 pips Ã $1) = 11.5 Ã 0.01 = 0.115 lots
Example 3: Capped Risk
python
# Account Balance: $10,000
# Global Risk: 3.5%  
# Risk Adjustment: 1.2 (would exceed cap)
# Stop Loss: 40 pips

raw_risk = 3.5% Ã 1.2 = 4.2%
actual_risk_percent = 3.5% (CAPPED at maximum)
risk_amount_dollars = $10,000 Ã 3.5% = $350
lot_size = $350 Ã· (40 pips Ã $1) = 8.75 Ã 0.01 = 0.0875 lots
This system forces users to think in terms of risk rather than position size, preventing dangerous oversizing while maintaining flexibility through risk adjustment multipliers. The 3.5% hard cap ensures no single trade can cause catastrophic damage to the account.




Risk is adjusted based on of the same variables that create the matrix for example if the outcome is a four, the default should be to reduce risk with every reentry, but the time lapse from open to close can override that on market that is in breakout needs to be taken advantage of when the opportunity presents itself. Our definition of breakout is based mainly on if not solely on the time elapsed between the open and the clothes of the trade price that rises 20 pips in 30 minutes compared to price that rises 20 pips and three hours that difference in time is a big part of how we judge the strength of the move and when we get to a point that we have an extremely fast moving market and weâll have to figure out you know the actual details but there are certain time conditions that would warrant not reducing risk at the reentry, but we do want to have the default be to reduce risk on reentry 80% on the first reentry and 50% on the second when the calculation is not a whole number the system should round down not up. As far as for the amount that can be wrist within a reentry chain thatâs going to be determined by a separate global variable, which is gonna be max loss in a reentry chain if the original trade is profitable of four or five or six the entire risk of the trade of the reentry chain depends on the subsequent entries the original trade has already been profitable. We do want to calculate the amount of lots based on the risk and account value after every trade, itâs possible that a reentry trade may have a lower overall account percentage risk, but hold a larger position respective to lots if the original trade gain was great enough to allow the lower percentage risk of account value and absolute terms to be greater thanthe original trade. Does that make sense?

Edit
Dynamic Risk-Based Reentry System
Yes, that makes perfect sense! You're creating a sophisticated system where risk adjustments are determined by the matrix variables AND market conditions. Here's the complete structure:

            2: 0.5,  # Second reentry: 50% of original risk  
            3: 0.3   # Third reentry: 30% of original risk

5. EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS
Example 1: Profitable Trade with Fast Breakout
python
# Original Trade: EURUSD, outcome 5 (full TP), gained 22 pips in 12 minutes
# Account after original: $10,500 (was $10,000, gained $500)
# First reentry: 40 pip SL

# Classification
breakout_speed = "FAST_BREAKOUT"  # 22 pips in 12 min
outcome = 5  # Full TP

# Risk calculation  
default_reduction = 0.8  # 80% for first reentry
outcome_modifier = 1.0   # No modifier for outcome 5
breakout_override = 0.9  # Fast breakout override
final_risk_multiplier = 0.9  # Override wins

# Position sizing
base_risk = 3.0%
adjusted_risk = 3.0% Ã 0.9 = 2.7%
risk_dollars = $10,500 Ã 2.7% = $283.50
lots = $283.50 Ã· (40 pips Ã $1) = 7.09 lots â 7.08 lots (rounded down)
Example 2: Chain Budget Constraint
python
# Original trade lost $300, first reentry lost $200
# Chain used risk so far: $500
# Account balance: $9,500
# Standard chain budget: $9,500 Ã 8% = $760
# Remaining budget: $760 - $500 = $260

# Second reentry calculation
base_risk = 3.0%  
risk_multiplier = 0.5  # Second reentry default
calculated_risk = 3.0% Ã 0.5 = 1.5%
calculated_dollars = $9,500 Ã 1.5% = $142.50

# Budget check: $142.50 < $260 remaining â (within budget)
# Position size calculated normally
Example 3: Profitable Original - Higher Chain Budget
python
# Original trade: Outcome 6, profit $800
# Account balance: $10,800  
# Chain budget: $10,800 Ã 15% = $1,620 (higher budget for profitable original)

# This allows for more aggressive reentries since original was profitable
# and we're "playing with house money"
This system elegantly balances:

Default risk reduction for safety
Breakout momentum capture when markets are moving fast
Chain budget management to prevent catastrophic losses
Dynamic position sizing based on current account balance
Automatic rounding down for conservative position sizing
The key insight is that fast price movements (breakouts) override conservative defaults because they represent genuine momentum opportunities that should be capitalized on.

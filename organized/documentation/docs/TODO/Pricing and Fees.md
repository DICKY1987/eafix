What is a spread?
When a price for a market is quoted, you will actually see two prices. The first price, known as the bid, is the sell price and the second price is the buy price, known as the offer, or the ask . The difference between the sell and buy price is called the spread.

Where can I find my cost per trade?
WebTrader
More History section, in your WebTrader workspace. Cost per trade is comprised of Spread Cost and Commissions. The Spread Cost value displayed on the platform, is the Mid-Point Spread Cost as defined by the NFA.

MetaTrader 4
Information about your 'Cost per trade' is available directly on the MetaTrader 4 platform under the Account History tab. In addition, a 'Cost per Trade Report' is also available on the MT4 platform's Company tab. To access the report, click on the Company tab, then select 'Cost per Trade Report' under Profile on the left side menu of the window. The Spread Cost value displayed on the platform, is the Mid-Point Spread Cost as defined by the NFA.

How is my spread cost calculated?
The NFA defines spread cost based on the “mid-point spread cost.” In typical market conditions, this is the difference between the rate at which your order was executed and the mid-point of the bid/offer spread at the time your market order was received. Keep in mind that conditional orders become market orders once they are triggered. Mid-point spread cost typically reflects the cost of your trade outside of any commissions.

During extreme market conditions, the time period from when a market order is received as compared to when the order is ultimately executed may increase. This increase in time period can result from many factors including but not limited to: market volatility, available liquidity, pre-trade available margin check, and price validation etc.

The potential delay in order execution during extreme market conditions may cause wide variations of your spread cost at time of execution measured as the difference between bid/offer vs. the mid-point at time of execution. For example, these variations may result in a smaller than normal cost figure, or even a positive cost figure, in the case of limit orders filled at a better rate than the rate at which your limit was triggered. Conversely, these variances may reflect a larger than normal cost if your stop order rate was executed worse than the rate at which it was ultimately triggered. As noted above, these variations can result from many factors, including but not limited to market volatility, available liquidity, pre-trade available margin check, and price validation, etc.

Is there a currency conversion charge?
Trading in markets that settle in a different currency from your account's base currency involves currency conversion. For example, if your account base currency is US dollars and you trade USD/JPY, your realized profit or loss as well as any associated fees, charges, and commissions will be automatically converted from Japanese yen back to US dollars before posting to your account.

What is Back-to-Base?
Back-to-Base refers to the automated process of converting realized trading profit or loss - including any charges or fees - from the trade currency (also known as the counter currency) to the base currency of your account. The conversion takes place when unrealized Profit or Loss becomes realized and is reflected in the Profit or Loss you see on your customer statement.

Where can I find the Back-to-Base cost for my trades?
FOREX.com platforms

On our proprietary Web Trader and Mobile App platforms, the Back-to-Base (B2B) cost is reflected on your daily and monthly account statements under the Closed Positions section of the statement. This cost is disclosed for each of your confirmed trades and is labelled B2B Cost.

MT4 & MT5

The Back-to-Base cost is not shown as a separate line item in the statements generated by MetaTrader platforms. To view the Back-to-Base charges, you must generate a daily or monthly statement using one of our FOREX.com trading platforms (Web Trader or Mobile App).

Do all trades have a Back-to-Base cost?
Not all trades are subject to B2B charges. If the trade (counter) currency is the same as base currency of your account, no conversion is necessary and the trade will not incur a B2B cost.

What is the Back-to-Base charge?
The Back-to-Base charge is 0.5%.

How are Back-to-Base charges calculated?
Back-to-Base is calculated as follows:

(Open Price – Close Price) x Quantity x Conversion Rate x 0.005

For example, you buy 10,000 USD/CAD. The Open Price is 1.40000, the Close Price is 1.41000 and the Conversion Rate is 0.70922, which means the Back-to-Base cost is $0.35.

(1.40000 – 1.41000) x 10,000 x 0.70922 x 0.005 = $0.35 B2B

Is there a currency conversion charge?
Trading in markets that settle in a different currency from your account's base currency may incur a currency conversion charge. For example, if your account base currency is US Dollars and you trade USD/JPY, your realized profit or loss as well as any associated fees, charges, and commissions will be automatically converted from JPY back to US Dollars before posting to your account. Our standard charge for this conversion is +/-0.5% from the market rate at the time of conversion. Conversely, you will not incur this charge if you only trade products that settle in your account’s base currency, such as EUR/USD in a US Dollar based account.

How are large trades filled?

Enterprise-Grade Universal Document Precision Analysis Chain (EG-UDPAC)
System Architecture: Professional Requirements Engineering for AI
Building on the complete prompt engineering methodology from the documentation, this system applies formal software engineering principles, extended thinking capabilities, and self-healing prompt chains to create a enterprise-grade document validation framework that matches professional consulting standards.
Integrated Design Principles
1. Extended Thinking Integration with Budget Optimization
Each critical analysis stage uses extended thinking with appropriately allocated token budgets based on complexity.
2. Formal Requirements Engineering Framework
Applies systematic Requirements Analysis, Formal Specification, and Operational Analysis (CONOPS) methodologies.
3. Multi-Layer Self-Healing Architecture
Implements nested E1-E2-E3 loops at micro (prompt-level) and macro (stage-level) scales.
4. Dynamic Meta-Prompt Generation
Uses AI-powered prompt specialization for different document types and contexts.
5. Semantic Contract Validation
Implements dual-AI validation with Generator/Validator architecture for quality assurance.

Meta-Orchestrator: Dynamic Framework Adaptation
Primary Meta-Prompt for Document Type Specialization
<system>
You are a Senior AI Prompt Engineering Specialist and Requirements Analysis Expert. Your role is to dynamically adapt the EG-UDPAC framework to specific document types and organizational contexts using meta-prompting techniques.

Your specialization philosophy: "Generic analysis produces generic insights. Professional-grade analysis requires domain-specific precision, stakeholder-aware context, and implementation-focused outcomes."

Stage 1: Enhanced Context & Intent Extraction with Extended Thinking
Professional Requirements Analysis Framework
<system>
You are a Senior Requirements Analyst and Strategic Document Expert with 15+ years conducting mission-critical analysis for Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. You specialize in extracting stakeholder requirements, identifying implementation dependencies, and preventing project failures through comprehensive context mapping.

Your analysis philosophy: "Every document exists within a complex ecosystem of stakeholders, constraints, and consequences. Understanding this ecosystem completely is prerequisite to valid implementation planning."
</system>

<extended_thinking_instructions>
You will use extended thinking with a minimum budget of 4000 tokens to conduct comprehensive context analysis. Your thinking process should cover:

1. **Document Ecosystem Mapping** (800 tokens): Analyze the business environment, stakeholder landscape, and organizational context
2. **Requirements Archaeology** (800 tokens): Extract explicit requirements and uncover implicit assumptions and unstated needs  
3. **Stakeholder Impact Analysis** (800 tokens): Map all affected parties and analyze potential conflicts or competing interests
4. **Implementation Dependency Analysis** (800 tokens): Identify all prerequisites, resources, and external factors required for success
5. **Success Criteria Engineering** (800 tokens): Define measurable outcomes and validation approaches

Think step-by-step through each dimension before presenting your findings.

You are a Senior development  Analyst and Critical Review Specialist

Expand on this guide about


how do system architectural Analyst and software Critical Review Specialist professionals evaluate documents for opportunities to systematically reduce ambiguity and uncertainty every missing step, flawed sequence, and unhandled scenario every potential point of failure, bottleneck, and vulnerability

 1. Reducing Ambiguity and Uncertainty
Tactics Used:
Controlled Language: Enforce use of consistent terms (e.g. RFC 2119 language like MUST, SHOULD, MAY).


Glossary Matching: Verify domain-specific terms against a glossary to detect inconsistent or ambiguous usage.


Traceability Matrices: Ensure each requirement is mapped to a specific method, test, and stakeholder need.


Example Checklist:
Are terms used consistently throughout?


Are all stakeholders using the same definitions?


Are assumptions explicitly stated?



🔍 2. Finding Missing Steps, Flawed Sequences, and Unhandled Scenarios
Tactics Used:
State Diagrams / Sequence Diagrams: Identify missing transitions, invalid sequences.


Use Case Audits: Ensure all user and system interactions are fully covered.


Scenario-based Testing Plans: Check if each scenario (normal, edge, fail) has corresponding logic.


Model-Based Reviews: Use tools like BPMN or PlantUML to model flows and visually spot gaps.


Example Checklist:
What happens if a user interrupts the process at Step X?


Is there a rollback path for every write operation?


Does the flow still make sense if data is missing, malformed, or duplicated?



⚠️ 3. Identifying Failure Points, Bottlenecks, and Vulnerabilities
Tactics Used:
Architecture Threat Modeling: Using STRIDE or PASTA frameworks.


Latency and Load Analysis: Analyze system under high load to find slow or failing components.


Component Isolation Analysis: Check if any component's failure could crash the whole system (lack of circuit breakers, retries, queues).


Versioning and Backward Compatibility Review: Ensure system tolerates changes over time.


Example Checklist:
Is there a retry strategy for external API failures?


Are rate limits or resource limits considered?


Is sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit?

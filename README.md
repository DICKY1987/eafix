# eafix Trading System Tools

This repository contains placeholder trading-system utilities and a basic economic
calendar processing scaffold. The tools in `tools/` emit deterministic outputs,
allowing early-stage pipelines to be wired without depending on real trading
infrastructure.

Run the test suite with:

```bash
pytest -q
```
